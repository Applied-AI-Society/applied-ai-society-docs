## The Opportunity

There has never been a better time to be young and comfortable with AI. Companies across every industry need people who can bridge the gap between what AI can do and what their business actually needs. That gap is the opportunity.

The K-shaped economy is real: companies that embrace AI will compound their advantage, while companies that don't will fall behind. Young practitioners who learn to help organizations cross that divide will be the most valuable hires of the next decade.

Culture transformation (helping companies develop an AI-first mindset) is the highest-leverage work in this space. But it starts with practitioners who understand both the technology and the humans using it.
