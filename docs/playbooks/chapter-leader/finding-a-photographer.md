# Finding an Event Photographer

A practical guide to sourcing affordable, reliable photography for Applied AI Society events.

---

## Why Photography Matters

Before you start hunting for a photographer, understand why you're doing it:

1. **Social proof** — Photos show the event is lively and popular. Future attendees see real people having a good time. That matters.

2. **Presenter value** — Give your speakers and presenters material they can use to promote themselves. It makes the event worth their time.

3. **Records of authority** — Build a visual archive that establishes the society's credibility over time.

You don't need fancy, magazine-quality photography. You need clear, well-lit documentation of what happened.

## How to Find a Photographer

### Start with your network

Ask around. Who do you know that takes decent photos? Maybe a friend with a good eye, a local freelancer, or someone in your community who's building their portfolio.

Trust matters more than credentials here. You want someone reliable who shows up on time and delivers what they promise.

### Be thrifty, not cheap

There's a difference. Cheap means cutting corners. Thrifty means getting good value.

**Budget anchor: ~$150 all-in** for a 2-3 hour event with reasonable commute distance. This is fair for someone building their portfolio or doing it as a side gig. Adjust based on your city and the photographer's experience.

If someone quotes significantly higher, ask what you're getting for the premium. If significantly lower, make sure they understand the deliverables.

## What to Capture

Give your photographer a shot list. These are the moments that matter:

| Moment | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **People registering / arriving** | Shows energy and turnout |
| **Programming shots** | Stage, presenter, engaged audience |
| **Case study sharing** | Captures the educational content |
| **Live architecting sessions** | The unique interactive element |
| **Guest speakers** | Promotional material for them |
| **Water cooler conversations** | Networking and community vibes |

Emphasize candid shots over posed ones. Real moments > staged moments.

## Deliverables and Exit Criteria

Be explicit about what you expect. Put this in writing before the event.

### Resolution
- Full-resolution JPEGs (not compressed for web)
- Minimum 300 DPI for print use
- No heavy filters or watermarks

### Volume
- Target: **50-100 usable photos** for a 2-3 hour event
- "Usable" means in focus, well-exposed, interesting composition
- It's okay if they shoot 300 and deliver 75 good ones

### Turnaround
- **1 week** for initial delivery is reasonable
- Ask for a preview of 5-10 photos within 48 hours if you need quick social content

### Format
- Delivered via Google Drive, Dropbox, or similar
- Organized by moment type is a plus but not required

## Template Messages

Copy, paste, customize. Don't start from scratch.
