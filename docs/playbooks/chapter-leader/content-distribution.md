# Content Distribution

Where to publish Applied AI Society content and why.

---

## Core Platforms

Four platforms matter most:

| Platform | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Substack** | Source of truth for articles. Email subscriptions. |
| **X (Twitter)** | Reach. Cross-post articles. X Articles for long-form. |
| **LinkedIn** | Reach. Cross-post articles with link to Substack. |
| **YouTube** | Full event recordings. Bingeable archive. |

X and LinkedIn are both trying to compete with Substack by promoting long-form content. Use this to your advantage. Publish the same articles on both.

---

## Articles: Substack First

Substack is home base for written content. Why:

- **Email subscriptions:** Readers can subscribe and get notified
- **Permanence:** Content lives in one canonical place
- **Ownership:** You control the list, not the platform algorithm

### Cross-posting strategy

1. Publish the full article on Substack
2. Post the same article on LinkedIn and X
3. Add a line at the bottom: *"Subscribe on Substack for more: [link]"*

This meets readers where they are (LinkedIn feed, X timeline) while funneling interested people to Substack where they can subscribe.

## X (Twitter)

X is a core distribution channel. Use it for:

- **Regular posts:** Event announcements, quotes, highlights, threads
- **X Articles:** Full long-form articles published natively on X

X Articles let you publish the same content you'd put on Substack, but natively on the platform. X promotes long-form content because they want to compete with newsletters. Take advantage of this.

### Cross-posting to X

Publish articles on both Substack and X Articles. Same content, different platforms. This maximizes reach without extra writing.

For regular posts, share highlights, quotes from case studies, and event updates. Tag practitioners when you feature them.

---

## Video: YouTube

YouTube is the default for video. Use it for:

- **Full event recordings:** People can binge past events
- **Conference talks:** As the society grows and hosts larger summits
- **Short clips:** Highlights and reels (also post these natively on LinkedIn/Instagram/TikTok)

Think of YouTube like AI.Engineer's channel: a library of valuable talks that compounds over time.

---

## Long-form Content Types

Two main categories:

### 1. Case study interviews

Practitioner profiles based on interviews. These live on Substack and get cross-posted.

See: [Case Study Interviews](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/case-study-interviews)

### 2. Event recaps and insights

Write-ups from events: what was discussed, key takeaways, interesting moments. These also live on Substack.

---

## Why This Matters

The goal isn't content for content's sake. It's:

1. **Subjects share their profiles.** When you publish a case study, the practitioner will share it with their network. This brings new people to the society.

2. **Events become evergreen.** A 2-hour event reaches 50 people in the room. The YouTube recording and written recap reach hundreds more over time.

3. **Authority compounds.** Each piece of content adds to the society's credibility. Over months and years, this becomes a moat.

## Event Discovery

Beyond content distribution, make sure your events are discoverable. Luma has a [Discover page](https://lu.ma/discover) with Featured Calendars and city-based Local Events. Submitting your events to these calendars is free and can drive significant attendance.
