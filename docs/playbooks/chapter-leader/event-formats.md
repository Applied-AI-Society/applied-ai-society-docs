# Event Formats

A catalog of event formats the Applied AI Society runs or is developing. Each format serves a different purpose and audience. Chapter leaders can mix and match based on what their local community needs.

The unifying thread: every AAS event is an **initiation into the applied AI economy**. Attendees leave with a clearer picture of what's real, what's possible, and who they can work with.

## Applied AI Live

*The flagship format. Promising and evolving.*

**What it is:** A 2-hour evening event where practitioners share field notes from real applied AI work, followed by networking. The format is still evolving. Early events included live whiteboard architecture sessions; the direction it's heading is more toward exposure and practitioner field reports: what's working, what's not, what surprised them, what they'd do differently.

**Who it's for:** AI-curious young people, experienced practitioners, business owners looking for solutions, and anyone exploring careers in applied AI.

**Cadence:** Monthly.

**Why it works:** Practitioners sharing honest field notes from the front lines of applied AI is genuinely hard to find anywhere else. The audience gets an unfiltered look at what the work actually looks like: real revenue, real clients, real workflows, real failures. That exposure is the core value. The format around it (talks, demos, Q&A, networking) will keep evolving as we learn what resonates most.

## Hackathons

*Building together. Often co-hosted with other communities.*

**What it is:** A focused building event where teams form, pick a problem, and ship something by the end of the day (or weekend). Can range from 8 hours to 24+ hours depending on ambition and logistics.

**Who it's for:** Builders. Engineers, designers, and product people who want to go from idea to working prototype with AI tooling.

**Cadence:** Quarterly or as opportunities arise. Great for co-hosting across multiple communities, which shares the lift and expands the audience.

**Why it works:** Hackathons surface the builders in your community. The people who show up and ship become future speakers, case study subjects, and collaborators. Co-hosting with other groups (AI meetups, startup communities, university clubs) builds cross-pollination that benefits everyone.

## Applied AI Office Hours

*New format. Debuting Q2 2026 at Capital Factory / Station Austin.*

**What it is:** A multi-hour coworking block where business owners come in with a specific problem and get whiteboarding time with applied AI engineers and practitioners. Not a presentation. Not a panel. Just focused, one-on-one (or small group) problem-solving.

**Who it's for:** Business owners and operators who have a real problem they want to think through with someone who understands AI. Also valuable for practitioners who want to sharpen their consulting skills and build their client pipeline.

**Cadence:** Monthly (first Tuesday of the month, 1:00 to 4:00 PM at Capital Factory / Station Austin for the initial run).

**Why it works:** Three things happen at once:

- **Business owners get real help** on a real problem, even if it's just 20 minutes of focused attention at a time
- **Practitioners and engineers compare notes** with each other and grow their consulting deal flow
- **The venue partner gets exposure** to business owners who might not otherwise know about the space

The format is intentionally low-key. No stage, no slides, no formal agenda. People drop in, get help, and leave with clarity. The intimate setting (3 to 6 practitioners in a medium-sized room) keeps it personal.

**Status:** Launching April 2026 in partnership with Capital Factory / Station Austin. This is an experiment. We'll document what works and share the playbook once we've run a few sessions.

## Formats We're Exploring

These are ideas on the roadmap. Not yet tested, but worth noting for chapter leaders planning ahead.

**Coworking sessions.** Informal, recurring time blocks where practitioners work alongside each other. No agenda, just proximity and conversation. Good for chapters that want a low-effort touchpoint between bigger events.

**Screening and discussion.** Watch a keynote, demo, or documentary together, then discuss. Low logistics, high conversation quality. Works well when a major AI announcement or product launch creates natural discussion topics.

**Panels.** Moderated conversations with 3 to 4 practitioners on a specific theme (pricing AI services, transitioning from traditional consulting, building AI products). Works best when the moderator is excellent and the panelists have real, contrasting experience.

## Choosing the Right Format

| Format | Effort Level | Best For | Audience Size |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Applied AI Live | Medium | Building your community, showcasing practitioners | 30 to 100+ |
| Hackathon | High | Surfacing builders, co-hosting with other groups | 20 to 80 |
| Office Hours | Low | Serving business owners, practitioner development | 5 to 20 |
| Coworking | Very Low | Community maintenance between events | 3 to 15 |
| Screening | Low | Discussion and community bonding | 10 to 40 |
| Panel | Medium | Deep dives on specific themes | 20 to 60 |

Start with Applied AI Live. It has the most documentation and is the natural entry point. Add other formats as your chapter matures and you learn what your local community needs most.
