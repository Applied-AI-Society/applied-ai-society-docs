# Finding a Venue

A great venue makes everything easier. A bad one creates friction. Here's how to find a space that works for Applied AI Live.

---

## The Gold Standard

The ideal venue has:

- **Built-in AV** — Mic, projector or screen, whiteboard. Less to haul, less to set up.
- **Convenient location** — Easy for your target audience to get to. Near public transit or with parking.
- **Free or low-cost** — You shouldn't be paying a lot. Partner venues are the goal.
- **Recurring availability** — Monthly is a good cadence. Lock in a consistent slot if you can.
- **Promotion support** — Venues that promote your event to their network are a bonus.

---

## Think Win-Win

Good venues aren't doing you a favor. They're getting something too.

**What venues want:**
- High-quality people in their space
- Association with smart, technical communities
- Pipeline for their programs (incubators, accelerators, membership)
- Content and buzz on social media

**What you offer:**
- A curated audience of engineers, business owners, and builders
- Regular programming that makes their space look active
- Social proof and photos they can share
- Zero hassle if you run clean events

When you pitch a venue, lead with what they get. Not what you need.

## Austin Case Study

Here's how we approached venues for Applied AI Live in Austin.

### January 2026: Antler VC HQ

For our first event, we partnered with the AITX Community, who had an existing relationship with Antler VC. Antler graciously hosted us at their headquarters in downtown Austin. The event drew ~100 check-ins with a 40% show rate — above the typical ~35% for similar meetups in Austin.

**Why it worked:**
- Antler runs an incubator. Engineer-founder types are exactly who they want in their space.
- AITX already had the relationship. We didn't have to start from scratch.
- Great location, good vibes, built-in AV.

### February 2026 onwards: Capital Factory

For recurring events, we secured a complementary monthly slot at Capital Factory. They're one of the leading meetup spaces in Austin and actively support high-quality community events.

**Why it worked:**
- Capital Factory wants to host meetups that bring smart people to their building.
- They offer free space to groups that meet their quality bar.
- Built-in AV, professional setup, central location.
- They promote events to their own community, which helps with attendance.

**Key lesson:** Start the conversation early. We coordinated at the end of 2025 to lock in our 2026 dates. If you wait until the last minute, good slots are taken.

## Where to Look

Ideas for finding partner venues:

| Type | Why They Might Host |
|------|---------------------|
| **Incubators / Accelerators** | Want deal flow, exposure to builders |
| **Coworking spaces** | Attract members, show off amenities |
| **Tech company offices** | Employer branding, recruiting |
| **Universities** | Community engagement, student exposure |
| **VC firms** | Meet founders, build reputation |
| **Libraries / Community centers** | Mission-aligned, often free |

## Start With Your Network

Cold outreach is not the move. Warm introductions work better.

Think about who you know:
- Friends who work at tech companies, VCs, or coworking spaces
- People in your network who run events and might share venue contacts
- Community leaders who already have venue relationships (like AITX did for us in Austin)

Ask around before you start emailing strangers. A warm intro from a friend converts way faster than a cold pitch.

---

## Talking Points for the Conversation

When you're chatting with a friend who might know a venue owner, keep it natural. You're not asking them to do outreach for you. You're just telling them what you're working on.

**What to cover:**

- **What it is**: "I'm starting a monthly meetup called Applied AI Live. It's for engineers who help businesses implement AI, and business owners who want to understand what's possible."

- **What happens**: "Each event has a practitioner sharing a real case study and a live session where an engineer solves a real business problem on the spot. It's hands-on, not a lecture."

- **Who shows up**: "The audience is technical, entrepreneurial. Engineers, founders, business owners. People building things."

- **The win-win**: "We're looking for a recurring venue. For the right space, it's a good deal. They get 50-75 smart, professional people in their building every month. Great for incubators, coworking spaces, VCs. Anyone who wants to be in front of builders."

If your friend knows someone, they'll offer to connect you. If it makes sense, they might just mention it to the venue person themselves. Either way, it feels organic because it is.

## Blurb Your Friend Can Forward

If your friend offers to reach out, give them something they can send:

> Hey [Venue contact],
>
> A friend of mine is organizing a monthly meetup called Applied AI Live. It's for engineers and business owners focused on practical AI implementation.
>
> Each event features real case studies from practitioners and a live session where an engineer solves an actual business problem on the spot. The audience is technical, entrepreneurial, and professional. They typically draw 50-75 people.
>
> They're looking for a recurring venue partner and I thought [Venue Name] could be a good fit. Seems like the kind of crowd you'd want in the building.
>
> Would you be open to an intro? Happy to connect you if so.

Short, clear, asks for permission first. Your friend doesn't have to write anything. They just send it.

## What to Ask

Once you're talking to a venue:

1. **Capacity** — How many people can the space hold? (Aim for 50-75 for a starter event)
2. **AV setup** — Do they have a mic, screen, whiteboard?
3. **Cost** — Is it free? If not, what's the rate?
4. **Recurring availability** — Can we book a regular slot (e.g., 4th Tuesday of each month)?
5. **Promotion** — Will they share the event with their community?
6. **Food policy** — Can we bring outside food? Any restrictions?
7. **AV connectivity** — What's the setup for connecting a laptop to the screen/TV? Can you do a test run before event day? (At our first event, the TV required on/off cycling to connect.)

## If You Must Cold Outreach

Warm intros are better, but sometimes you don't have a connection. Here's a template:

> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm organizing Applied AI Live, a monthly meetup for engineers and business owners focused on practical AI implementation. We feature case studies from practitioners and live problem-solving sessions.
>
> I'm looking for a venue partner in [City] and thought [Venue Name] could be a great fit. Our audience is technical, entrepreneurial, and exactly the kind of people who might be interested in [what they offer — incubator, coworking, etc.].
>
> We typically draw 50-75 people. We run clean, professional events and would be happy to promote your space to our community.
>
> Would you be open to a conversation about hosting us? I'd love to find a recurring arrangement if possible.
>
> Thanks,
> [Your name]

---

## Tips

- **Start with your network.** Warm intros beat cold emails every time.
- **Start early.** Good spaces book up. Begin venue outreach 6+ weeks before your target date.
- **Lock in recurring slots.** Monthly consistency beats one-off scrambling.
- **Be a good guest.** Leave the space better than you found it. Venues remember.
- **Follow up with thanks.** A quick note after the event goes a long way.
