# Applied AI Live

A workshop series for people who want to make money by practically applying AI to real-world business problems.

---

## What Is It?

Applied AI Live is a recurring event format. The goal: create a Schelling point for practitioners who are actually making a living helping businesses integrate AI.

Each event features:
- **Practitioner talks** — Real case studies from people doing the work
- **Live problem-solving** — A real business owner presents an actual problem, and an engineer architects a solution on the spot
- **Networking** — Time for attendees to connect and share notes

This isn't a lecture series. It's a working session for people in the trenches.

## Who Should Attend?

Three types of people:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Applied AI Engineers** | Engineers and developers building a career (or side income) helping businesses implement AI. Includes new grads trying to stand out. |
| **Business Owners** | People with real business problems who want to understand what's possible and find trustworthy help. |
| **Tool Builders** | Technical leaders building platforms, frameworks, or infrastructure for applied AI. Looking for practitioner feedback. |

## Name Tags: Color-Coded by Role

One small thing that makes a big difference: **color-coded name tags**.

The goal is to help attendees find each other. An Applied AI Engineer looking for business owners to help should be able to spot them across the room. A Tool Builder looking for practitioner feedback should know who to approach.

### The Ideal

Printed name tags with:
- **Role at the top**: "Applied AI Engineer," "Business Owner," or "Tool Builder"
- **Event name at the bottom**: "Applied AI Live"

This way people know who they're talking to and remember what event they met at.

### The Easy, Cheap Version

Three different colors of blank name tags. Assign one color per role. Announce the color coding at the start of the event.

| Color | Role |
|-------|------|
| 🟠 Orange | Applied AI Engineer |
| 🔵 Blue | Business Owner |
| 🟢 Green | Tool Builder |

(Pick whatever colors are available. Just be consistent.)

### Where to Get Them

Blank adhesive name tags come in multi-color packs. Check Amazon or any office supply store. A pack of 200 costs ~$10.

*More detailed guidance on name tag logistics coming soon.*
