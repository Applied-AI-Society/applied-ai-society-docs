# Applied AI Live

A workshop series where AI-native young people and experienced practitioners learn together by solving real business problems.

---

## What Is It?

Applied AI Live is a recurring event format. The goal: create a Schelling point where young people comfortable with AI can learn from experienced practitioners, tackle real problems, and start building their professional network.

Each event features:
- **Practitioner talks:** Real case studies from people doing the work
- **Live problem-solving:** A real business owner presents an actual problem, and a practitioner architects a solution on the spot
- **Networking:** Time for attendees to connect and share notes

This isn't a lecture series. It's a working session for anyone ready to apply AI professionally.

---

## Who Should Attend?

Four types of people:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AI-Native Young People** | People in their early 20s who use AI tools daily and want to apply that fluency professionally. Students, recent grads, career changers. You don't need to be a traditional coder. |
| **Experienced Practitioners** | Engineers and practitioners who are already doing the work. Your experience is invaluable to the young people in the room, and you'll learn from their fresh perspective too. |
| **Business Owners** | People with real business problems who want to understand what's possible and find trustworthy help. |
| **Tool Builders** | Technical leaders building platforms, frameworks, or infrastructure for applied AI. Looking for practitioner feedback. |

## Master Checklist

A high-level view of everything that goes into running an Applied AI Live event. Links point to detailed guides where available.

### 4+ Weeks Before

- [ ] Secure venue (partner space preferred). See [Finding a Venue](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/finding-a-venue)
- [ ] Confirm practitioner speaker for case study. See [Case Study Interviews](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/case-study-interviews)
- [ ] Find business owner for live architecture session. See [Live Architecture Session](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/live-architecture-session)
- [ ] Confirm practitioner to architect the solution
- [ ] Create event page (Meetup and/or Luma). See [Tools](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/tools)
- [ ] Write event description. See [Writing Event Descriptions](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/writing-event-descriptions)

### 3 Weeks Before

- [ ] Start promoting the event (social, community channels, word of mouth)
- [ ] Submit event to relevant Luma Featured Calendars (see [Luma Calendar Submissions](#luma-calendar-submissions))
- [ ] Generate event flyer. See [Generating Flyers](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/generating-flyers)
- [ ] Confirm photographer. See [Finding a Photographer](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/finding-a-photographer)
- [ ] Figure out recording setup. See [Recording an Event](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/recording-an-event)
- [ ] Order name tags (color-coded or custom printed)
- [ ] Order branded staff shirts

### 2 Weeks Before

- [ ] Conduct pre-call with business owner
- [ ] Write problem brief from pre-call. See [Live Architecture Session](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/live-architecture-session)
- [ ] Send problem brief to engineer
- [ ] Continue promoting and accepting RSVPs
- [ ] Schedule food delivery

### 1 Week Before

- [ ] Reconfirm with photographer and videographer
- [ ] Pick up custom stickers/name tags if not delivered
- [ ] Confirm food delivery plan
- [ ] Confirm AV setup with venue
- [ ] Reconfirm with all speakers

### Day Of

- [ ] Send a hype video and/or reminder blast in the morning (see below)
- [ ] Arrive early for setup
- [ ] Set up registration table with laptop and name tags
- [ ] Confirm food delivery and arrange spread
- [ ] Set computer to never sleep/hibernate
- [ ] Test both mics
- [ ] Charge portable speaker and queue up music playlist
- [ ] Brief photographer and videographer
- [ ] Run the event (see Run of Show below)
- [ ] Clean up and thank venue staff

**The morning hype video:**
If your event is in the evening, record a quick video that morning. Post it to social and send it to RSVPs. Get people excited. Remind them this isn't a normal meetup. Cover what's happening, why it matters, and what they'll get out of attending. Bonus: film it at or near the venue. Show them where to park, which entrance to use, any logistical details that reduce friction. A personal video converts more RSVPs into actual attendees.

**The day-of reminder blast:**
In addition to (or instead of) a video, send a written blast to your RSVP list the morning or midday of the event. Paint a picture of what attending means for them. At Applied AI Live #1, a blast went out at 11:29 AM with the subject line *"For many of you, tonight is the night that changes everything"* (a future-looking message that asked RSVPs to imagine looking back a year from now on all the clients, friendships, and partnerships that started that night). It closed with urgency without pressure: "If you can't make it tonight, that's okay, we're going to have more events. But I think you're going to want to be here for the launch." This likely contributed to the 40% show rate (above the typical ~35%). Make it personal, make it vivid, and send it early enough that people can adjust their evening plans.

### After the Event

- [ ] Thank partners, speakers, and volunteers
- [ ] Share photos and recording with attendees
- [ ] Collect feedback
- [ ] Update this playbook with lessons learned

---

## Budget

Applied AI Live events should be cheap to run. The goal is replicability. Any chapter should be able to host one without a huge budget.

**Real costs from Applied AI Live #1 (~100 attendees):**

| Category | Actual Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| Venue | $0 (partner venue) |
| Food (Firehouse Subs, small platters) | ~$250 |
| Videography + photography (one person) | ~$300 |
| Branded shirts (10, for staff/volunteers/speakers) | ~$100–150 |
| Printed flyers | ~$70 |
| Name tags (Minuteman Press) | ~$50 |
| Registration desk | $0 (volunteers) |
| **Total** | **~$770–820** |

**Budget roughly $1,000 for an Applied AI Live event.** This assumes a free venue through partnerships, which is why partnerships are so important (see [Building Partnerships](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/building-partnerships)). If you handle your own photos/video and skip shirts, you can run leaner, but the full experience is worth the investment.

### The Human Cost

Ideally, the organizer's time and any volunteer help (photography, registration, etc.) isn't "paid for" in the traditional sense. The value is intrinsic: these are people who genuinely want to network with this community. Running or helping with the event gives them access and credibility.

Find people who want to be there anyway. The photographer who's an aspiring applied AI practitioner. The volunteer who wants to meet business owners. That's the model.

### On Sponsorship

Sponsorship gives you more flexibility, but it's not a precedent you need to set. The beauty of keeping events cheap is that any chapter can run them without waiting for funding. Sponsorship is a nice-to-have, not a requirement.

The Applied AI Society is supported by founding sponsors **OpenTeams** and **OT Incubator**. [Learn more about our founding sponsors](/).

## Example Run of Show

A typical 2-hour Applied AI Live event:

| Time | Segment |
|------|---------|
| 5:30 PM | Doors open. Food out. Networking. |
| 6:00 PM | Welcome + housekeeping (5 min) |
| 6:05 PM | Sponsor remarks (10–15 min) |
| 6:20 PM | Practitioner talk: Case study with Q&A (30 min) |
| 6:50 PM | Live architecture session: Business owner presents problem, engineer architects solution on whiteboard (30 min) |
| 7:20 PM | Open networking |
| 7:30 PM | Wrap |

Adjust based on your speakers and venue. The live architecture session is the signature element. Protect time for it.

**Tip:** Use auto-rotating animated slides during downtime and transitions (doors open, breaks, networking). This keeps the screen active with branding, sponsor info, or upcoming announcements instead of a static or blank display. It fills dead air visually and keeps energy in the room.

---

## Audio/Visual

Keep it simple. You don't need a full AV setup.

**The basics:**
- A handheld mic or portable speaker so presenters can be heard
- A screen or TV if someone is presenting slides (optional)
- Whiteboard or large sticky notes for live architecture sessions

Many venues provide basic AV. Ask during your venue walkthrough.

**Warnings from Live #1:**
- **Set your computer to never sleep/hibernate.** At our first event, the computer went to sleep mid-presentation. Avoid this by changing your power settings before the event starts.
- **Bring a backup mic.** Only one of our two mics worked at Live #1. The workaround: the host spoke loudly without a mic so the guest could use the single working mic. It worked, but having a backup would have been better.
- **TV/display connectivity can be finicky.** The TV required on/off cycling to connect to the laptop. Test this during setup, not during the event.

If the room is small enough (under 30 people) and acoustics are good, you might not need a mic at all. But for larger groups or noisy spaces, make sure speakers can project.

For recording considerations, see the [Recording an Event](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/recording-an-event) playbook.

---

## Music

Background music during networking windows (doors open, breaks, post-event) makes a huge difference. A quiet room feels awkward. Music sets the vibe and gives people permission to talk.

**The setup:**
- A portable Bluetooth speaker, plugged in so it doesn't die
- Volume low enough that people can talk without raising their voices
- Kill the music when someone is on mic

**What to play:**
- No lyrics. Instrumental, lo-fi, or ambient works best. Lyrics compete with conversation.
- Chill but energetic. You want warm, social energy, not a library or a club.
- Curated playlists beat random radio. Pick something ahead of time and let it run.

**Recommended playlists:**
- [Spotify: Lo-Fi Beats](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX889U0CL85jj) (instrumental, low-key, crowd-tested)
- [YouTube: Lo-Fi Girl livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLRRXURicM) (reliable fallback, always on)

Add "Charge portable speaker" and "Queue up music playlist" to your Day Of checklist.

---

## Name Tags: Color-Coded by Role

One small thing that makes a big difference: **color-coded name tags**.

The goal is to help attendees find each other. A young AI native looking for experienced practitioners to learn from should be able to spot them across the room. A business owner looking for talent should know who to approach.

### The Ideal

Printed name tags with:
- **Role at the top**: "AI Native," "Practitioner," "Business Owner," or "Tool Builder"
- **Event name at the bottom**: "Applied AI Live"

This way people know who they're talking to and remember what event they met at.

### The Easy, Cheap Version

Four different colors of blank name tags. Assign one color per role. Announce the color coding at the start of the event.

| Color | Role |
|-------|------|
| 🟡 Yellow | AI Native |
| 🟠 Orange | Experienced Practitioner |
| 🔵 Blue | Business Owner |
| 🟢 Green | Tool Builder |

(Pick whatever colors are available. Just be consistent.)

### Where to Get Them

Blank adhesive name tags come in multi-color packs. Check Amazon or any office supply store. A pack of 200 costs ~$10.

### Custom Printing

For custom name tags or sticker sheets, local print shops offer fast turnaround (often 2 days). Expect ~$90 for 72 custom stickers. Services like Sticker Mule work well for bulk orders. **Minuteman Press** is another reliable vendor for custom printing with locations nationwide.

At Applied AI Live #1, attendees called the custom name tags out as a highlight. They made the purpose of the event immediately legible. Don't underestimate this detail.

![Custom printed name tags from Applied AI Live #1](/img/events/live-1/nametags.jpg)

**Conversation starter stickers** are a nice add-on. Small stickers people can add to their name tags like "Ask me what I'm building" or "Open to work" help break the ice.

---

## Branded Shirts

A small investment that punches above its weight. At Live #1, we ordered ~10 branded shirts for ~$100. Minimalistic design: white text, orange gradient on black. Staff wore them at the registration desk.

The effect is instant professionalism. Attendees walk in and immediately see an organized team. It signals that this isn't a casual hangout; it's a real event run by real people. Great ROI for perceived quality.

Order them 3+ weeks before your event to allow for printing and shipping. Keep the design simple. The brand should be recognizable but not loud.

---

## Food & Drinks

Keep it thrifty and replicable. The goal is programming valuable enough that people come for that, not fancy catering.

### The Default: Subs or Pizza

For a 5:30–7:30pm event, people will be hungry. Options:

| Option | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Jimmy John's subs** | Cut into pieces. Include vegan options. ~$8–10 per sub. |
| **Firehouse Subs** | Proven at Live #1. ~$250 for a large group. Include veggie options. Substantial and crowd-pleasing. |
| **Pizza** | Classic engineer event food. Cheap. Everyone knows what to expect. |
| **Small bites** | Cheese, meats, vegetables, small sandwiches. More upscale but pricier. |

Have food ready **25 minutes before doors open**. Early arrivals set the social tone for the whole event. When people walk in to food already laid out, they start networking immediately instead of standing around waiting. Always include veggie options.

![Firehouse Subs platters, the proven option](/img/events/live-1/firehouse-subs.png)

### How Much?

For free events, expect **50% of RSVPs to actually show up**. If you have 100 RSVPs, plan food for 50.

Don't advertise it as a dinner event. Frame it as "light food provided" or first-come-first-serve.

### Drinks

- Cases of bottled water (~$5–10)
- Cups for people who prefer using a water fountain
- No need for anything fancier unless the venue provides it

---

## Registration

### Setup

- Laptop with Luma (or your registration platform) open
- Name tags sorted by color/role
- One or two people at the desk

### Flow

1. Attendee arrives
2. Check them in on Luma
3. Hand them the appropriate name tag based on their role
4. Point them toward food/networking area

Having an extroverted "connector" person near registration helps. Someone who can introduce newcomers to each other and break the ice.

---

## Luma Calendar Submissions

One of the most effective (and free) ways to get attendees is submitting your event to **Luma Featured Calendars**. These are curated community calendars that surface events to subscribers interested in specific topics or cities.

### Why This Matters

When you create an event on Luma, it lives on your personal page by default. Most people won't find it unless you share the link directly. But Luma also has a [Discover page](https://lu.ma/discover) with **Featured Calendars** (topic-based like "AI" or "Tech") and **Local Events** (city-based like "Austin" or "San Francisco"). Getting your event listed on these calendars puts it in front of thousands of subscribers who are already looking for events like yours.

At Applied AI Live, we've seen real attendees come from Luma calendar discovery. OpenClaw Meetups, for example, appears as a Featured Calendar on Luma's Discover page. The Austin local calendar is another one worth targeting.

### How to Submit

1. Go to [lu.ma/discover](https://lu.ma/discover) and browse the Featured Calendars and Local Events sections
2. Find calendars relevant to your event (AI, Tech, your city)
3. Open the calendar page and look for a "Submit Event" option
4. Fill in your event details and submit
5. The calendar admin reviews your submission. If approved, your event appears on that calendar's public schedule

### Which Calendars to Target

| Calendar Type | Examples | Why |
|---------------|----------|-----|
| **Topic calendars** | AI, Tech, Open Source | Reaches people interested in the subject matter |
| **City calendars** | Austin, San Francisco, New York | Reaches local attendees who are browsing for things to do |
| **Community calendars** | OpenClaw Meetups, Cursor Community, etc. | Reaches aligned communities with overlapping interests |

### Tips

- **Submit early.** Do this 3+ weeks before your event. Calendar admins may take a few days to review submissions.
- **Write a strong event description.** Calendar admins are curating quality. A well-written description with clear value proposition gets approved faster. See [Writing Event Descriptions](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/writing-event-descriptions).
- **Submit to multiple calendars.** Your event can appear on several calendars at once. Cast a wide net.
- **Subscribe to calendars yourself.** Follow the calendars in your city and topic area. This helps you stay aware of what other organizers are doing and spot collaboration opportunities.

## Cleanup

Before you leave:

- [ ] Collect leftover food (offer to attendees first)
- [ ] Gather trash, dispose properly
- [ ] Return furniture to original positions
- [ ] Check for any personal items left behind
- [ ] Thank venue staff

Most venues appreciate when you leave things cleaner than you found them. It helps with future partnerships.

---

## Thanking Partners

Gratitude is key. After an event, take time to thank the people who made it happen:

- Venue hosts
- Speakers and presenters
- Volunteers who helped with registration, photos, or setup
- Sponsors
- Community partners who helped promote

A quick thank-you text is fine. A voice note is better. A heartfelt voice note ecard is memorable.

**Tool recommendation:** [Blessout](https://blessout.com/) lets you send voice note ecards. Record a genuine thank-you, pick a visual, and send. Takes 2 minutes. Makes people feel appreciated.

Partnerships compound. The venue that felt thanked is more likely to host you again. The speaker who felt valued will refer other speakers. Small gestures build long-term relationships.
