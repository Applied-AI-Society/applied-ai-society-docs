# Applied AI Live

A workshop series for people who want to make money by practically applying AI to real-world business problems.

---

## What Is It?

Applied AI Live is a recurring event format. The goal: create a Schelling point for practitioners who are actually making a living helping businesses integrate AI.

Each event features:
- **Practitioner talks** — Real case studies from people doing the work
- **Live problem-solving** — A real business owner presents an actual problem, and an engineer architects a solution on the spot
- **Networking** — Time for attendees to connect and share notes

This isn't a lecture series. It's a working session for people in the trenches.

## Who Should Attend?

- Engineers and developers building a career (or side income) in applied AI
- New grads trying to stand out in a changed job market
- Technical leaders evaluating AI tools and workflows
- Business owners curious about what's actually possible
