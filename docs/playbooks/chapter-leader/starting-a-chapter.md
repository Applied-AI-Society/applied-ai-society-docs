# Starting a Chapter

How to launch an Applied AI Society chapter in your city or on your campus.

---

## Why Chapters Exist

There's a massive gap between what AI can do and what organizations are actually doing with it. That gap is an opportunity for a generation of practitioners who figure out how to close it.

Applied AI Society chapters are hyperlocal communities where that happens. Practitioners share what they're building, business owners get real help, and everyone builds a network that creates real career and business opportunities. Chapters are led locally, funded locally, and rooted in the specific needs of their city or campus.

The model is subsidiarity: national provides the playbooks, brand, and network. You provide the energy, the people, and the local context.

## You're a Good Fit to Start a Chapter If...

- **You're entrepreneurial.** You see building an applied AI network as completely in your self interest. You want to be at the center of your city's applied AI economy, not waiting for someone to hand you the opportunity.
- **You're a connector.** You don't need to be the most technical person in the room. You need to be the person who gets the right people into the room.
- **You can mobilize.** Given two weeks' notice, you can get 50-75 people to show up. You already have a network, or you know how to build one fast.
- **You recognize the implementation gap.** You see organizations around you that know they should be using AI but have no idea how. That frustrates you.
- **You're high agency, low ego.** You'll figure things out without waiting to be told what to do. You'll give credit to others and focus on the community, not your personal brand.
- **You're in the right life stage.** Late college, just graduated, or early career. Or you're someone who mentors people in that window and wants to build alongside them.

## This Probably Isn't for You If...

- You're looking for a paid position from day one. Chapter leaders earn through the network they build, not a salary from national.
- You want a detailed instruction manual for every decision. We provide playbooks and support, but you're running your chapter. Ownership is the point.
- You're mainly interested in hosting speaker series or lecture-style events. Applied AI Society events are practitioner-driven and hands-on. If nobody's building anything, it's not an Applied AI event.
- You don't actually want to be in the applied AI space yourself. Chapter leaders are practitioners first, organizers second.

## What National Provides

**Playbooks.** Everything we've learned from the Austin genesis chapter is documented publicly. Event formats, checklists, partnership guides, content distribution workflows, CRM setup, outreach automation. You don't start from scratch.

**Brand assets.** Logo, design system, templates. You stay on-brand while making it your own locally. There's no shortage of things to fork and take inspiration from.

**Light sponsorship for early events.** We'll help cover the first couple of events to remove the financial barrier. Campus events with a room, AV, and volunteers are genuinely cheap. The goal is to get you to the point where local sponsors take over.

**The network.** You're not building alone. You plug into a national (and soon global) community of chapter leaders, practitioners, and sponsors. What works in Austin, Bordeaux, or LA gets shared with you immediately.

**Mentorship.** You can text Gary whenever. Early on, you can do a weekly call if you want. The communication cadence will evolve as we figure out what works, but you won't be left on your own.

**The slides platform.** Access to the Applied AI Society presentation platform for running Applied AI Live events with animated slides, live workshops, audience Q&A, and presenter remotes.

## What's Expected of You

**Run events.** The core of any chapter is regular events. Start with monthly. The flagship format is [Applied AI Live](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/applied-ai-live), but hackathons, build-a-thons, and coworking sessions all count. People need to be in a room together, doing things.

**Find your local patron.** Every chapter needs a local champion: a business owner, executive, or organization that believes in what you're building and wants to support it. This isn't a cold sponsorship pitch. It's finding someone who sees the value of a local applied AI talent network and wants to say "I planted this chapter." This usually happens naturally after your first couple of events prove the model.

**Create stickiness.** The north star metric for a new chapter is retention: 20 or more people who keep coming back across your first three events because the events are genuinely that valuable. If people come once and don't return, something needs to change. If they keep showing up, everything else (sponsors, growth, opportunities) follows.

**Share what you learn.** Write event recaps. Document what worked and what didn't. The whole system gets better when chapters feed insights back to the network.

**Stay on brand.** You have freedom in how you run your chapter. The required protocols for communicating with national are still being defined, but the principle is simple: use whatever tools let you flow and get things done as a local organizer, and keep us in the loop on how it's going.

## The Opportunity

This is worth saying plainly: the applied AI economy is real and growing fast. Organizations are desperate for people who can actually implement AI, not just talk about it. Chapter leaders sit at the center of their local version of that economy. You meet every practitioner, every business owner, every sponsor in your city who cares about this space.

The network you build as a chapter leader is yours. The relationships, the reputation, the deal flow. We call it enlightened self interest: you're building something that serves your community and your career at the same time.

The people who figure out applied AI now, while the gap is wide open, will be the ones everyone else calls in two years.

## How to Get Started

1. **Read the docs.** Start with [What is the Applied AI Society?](/docs/about) and the [Applied AI Canon](/docs/philosophy/canon). If the philosophy resonates, keep going.
2. **Read the playbooks.** Browse the [chapter leader playbooks](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader) to see what running a chapter actually looks like. Pay special attention to [Applied AI Live](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/applied-ai-live) and [Building Partnerships](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/building-partnerships).
3. **Reach out.** [Get in touch](https://appliedaisociety.org/contribute), or have the person who connected you with Applied AI Society introduce you to Gary Sheng directly. Text, WhatsApp, or email all work.
4. **Have a conversation.** We'll talk about your city, your network, what format makes sense, and what support you need.
5. **Run your first event.** We'll help you get the first one off the ground. From there, you're building.
