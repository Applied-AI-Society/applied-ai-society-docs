# Recording an Event

A practical guide for recording Applied AI Society events on a budget.

---

## Why Record Events

1. **Reach people who couldn't attend** — Let them get value as if they were there
2. **Build a content library** — Each event becomes a permanent resource
3. **Show what the events are like** — Prospective attendees can see what they're signing up for
4. **Create promotional clips** — Raw footage becomes reels and short-form content

The full event recording is one output. But the raw footage is also source material for short clips: "We live architected a document processing system in 10 minutes" with cuts between the main camera, Ray-Ban POV, and whiteboard close-ups. These clips drive social engagement and attract new attendees.

## Core Principle: Thriftiness

Professional film crews charge thousands for event recording. You don't need that.

With smartphones, consumer gear, and smart workflows, you can produce solid event recordings for almost nothing. Budget $50-100 for editing if you outsource it. The gear you already own.

---

## Recording Setup Options

### Option 1: DIY Basic

**Cost:** $0 (gear you already have)

- Smartphone on a tripod or phone stand
- Built-in microphone
- Continuous recording for the full event

This often works better than you'd expect. Modern smartphone cameras are excellent. And if your presenters are using handheld mics amplified through room speakers, your phone can capture that audio just fine. Put the phone on a stand at a reasonable distance and let it roll.

Audio only becomes a problem in quiet rooms with no amplification, or spaces with bad echo.

### Option 2: DIY Better (for unamplified rooms)

**Cost:** $50-150 for a lavalier or bluetooth mic

- Smartphone on a tripod for video
- Separate audio recording with a lavalier mic on the presenter (wired or bluetooth)
- Merge video and audio in post using Descript or similar

This is worth it if your venue doesn't have amplified speakers. But if presenters are already miced up to a PA system, you probably don't need this.

### Option 3: Venue AV Support

**Cost:** Often included with venue rental

Some venues have in-house AV support. For example, Capital Factory in Austin provides recording capabilities as part of their event hosting.

If your venue offers this, use it. Ask what they provide and what format you'll get the files in.

---

## Audio Backup Redundancy

**Critical rule: always have multiple audio backups.**

Devices fail. Batteries die. Storage fills up. If you only have one audio source and it fails, you have unusable footage.

Run at least 2-3 of these simultaneously:

| Backup | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| iPhone on stand | Plugged into charger, Voice Memos running |
| Standalone voice recorder | Cheap and reliable, e.g., Sony ICD series |
| Apple Watch | Voice Memos app, worn by you or staff |
| Spare iPhone | Voice Memos running in your pocket or on a table |

You'll pick the best audio source in post. The others are insurance.

## Meta Ray-Ban Glasses (Experimental)

Smart glasses like Meta Ray-Bans add a unique dimension: host POV footage.

Use them for:
- **Close-ups of the whiteboard** during live architecting
- **Business owner explaining their problem** — get up close
- **Audience reactions** — pan the room naturally
- **B-roll** — arrivals, networking, the vibe of the space

This footage won't be your primary source, but it adds personality and immersion. It makes viewers feel like they're in the room with you.

One tap to start/stop recording. Wear them throughout the event.

## What to Capture

### Primary footage

- Main stage / presenter (this is most of your final video)
- Screen share if they're presenting slides
- Whiteboard close-ups if they're drawing/architecting

### Secondary footage (B-roll)

- Audience listening, reacting
- Networking conversations
- People arriving, registering
- The room setup, signage

### Raw materials

Ask presenters for their slides or any materials they used. Useful for the edit and for follow-up content.

## Pre-Event Tech Check

Do this **before** attendees arrive:

- [ ] All devices fully charged
- [ ] Storage cleared (delete old files, check available space)
- [ ] Tripod/stand stable and positioned
- [ ] Test audio levels — record 30 seconds, play it back
- [ ] Backup audio devices ready and tested
- [ ] Smart glasses synced and charged (if using)
- [ ] Know how to start/stop recording on all devices

---

## File Management

### Naming convention

Use: `YYYY-MM-DD_City_EventName_Source`

Examples:
- `2026-01-29_Austin_AppliedAILive_MainCamera.mp4`
- `2026-01-29_Austin_AppliedAILive_AudioBackup1.m4a`
- `2026-01-29_Austin_AppliedAILive_RayBan.mp4`
- `2026-01-29_Austin_AppliedAILive_PresenterSlides.pdf`

### Post-event

1. **Upload to cloud immediately** — Don't wait. Phones get lost, drives fail.
2. **Organize by event date** — One folder per event
3. **Keep raw files** — Never delete originals until final video is published

---

## Finding an Editor

You can edit this yourself, but if you want to outsource:

### Budget

$50-100 for a 2-hour event edit is reasonable. You're asking for:
- Sync audio to video
- Cut dead time (setup, breaks)
- Basic transitions between segments
- Add title cards if needed

### How to find someone

Same approach as [Finding a Photographer](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/finding-a-photographer):
- Ask your network
- Look for film students or freelancers building their portfolio
- Trust and reliability matter more than flashy reels

### Template outreach

```
Subject: Video editing for Applied AI Society event

Hey [NAME],

I'm looking for someone to edit a 2-hour event recording for the Applied AI Society.

The raw footage is already captured. I need:
- Audio synced to video (I have multiple sources)
- Dead time cut (setup, breaks)
- Basic transitions between segments
- Title cards at the start

Budget is around $[75-100]. Turnaround within 1 week would be ideal.

Let me know if you're interested and I'll share the raw files.

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
```

## Final Output

### Full event recording

The finished video should:
- **Weave together** main stage footage with screen share or whiteboard toggles
- **Use the cleanest audio source** from your backups
- **Feel immersive** — B-roll and POV footage help
- **Be watchable** — Someone who missed the event should get full value

### Short-form clips and reels

Don't just publish the full recording. Cut the raw footage into short clips for social:
- "We live architected a document processing pipeline" (2-3 min highlight)
- "This business owner's AI problem, solved in real time" (60 sec reel)
- Behind-the-scenes montage of the event vibe

Mix sources: main camera for the presenter, Ray-Ban POV for whiteboard close-ups, audience reactions. These clips drive engagement and attract people to future events.

### Where to publish

- **YouTube** — Full recordings + short clips
- **Instagram/TikTok/LinkedIn** — Reels and highlights
- **Website** — Embed on the event page
- **Newsletter** — Share with your mailing list
