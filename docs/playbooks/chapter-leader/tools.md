# Chapter Leader Tools

A collection of tools that help run chapters efficiently. These aren't endorsements. They're just what's working for us right now.

---

## Meetup.com

**What it is:** Event discovery and RSVP platform with built-in audience.

**Website:** [meetup.com](https://meetup.com)

**What we use it for:**
- Event listings and RSVPs
- Organic discovery by people who attend similar events
- Building a chapter-specific audience over time

**Why it's useful:**
Meetup recommends your events to users who have attended similar meetups. This is free distribution. With zero extra marketing or ad spend, dozens of people have found Applied AI Society events just through Meetup's recommendation algorithm.

We run an **Applied AI Society network** on Meetup, which allows multiple chapters to operate under one umbrella. The Austin chapter is the first. When new chapters launch, they join the network.

**Tips:**
- Create your chapter's Meetup under the Applied AI Society network
- Keep event descriptions clear and focused on who should attend
- Meetup users expect consistency. Recurring events build momentum.
- You can use Meetup as your sole RSVP platform or pair it with something else

## Luma

**What it is:** Event page and RSVP platform with a polished UX.

**Website:** [lu.ma](https://lu.ma)

**What we use it for:**
- Beautiful event pages for sharing on social
- Clean check-in experience at the door
- Integration with calendar apps

**Why it's useful:**
Luma looks great. The event pages are modern and easy to share. If you're promoting on Twitter/X or LinkedIn, a Luma link feels more premium than a basic Meetup page.

**Trade-off:**
Luma doesn't have Meetup's built-in discovery. It's a destination, not a recommendation engine. If you use Luma, you need to drive all your own traffic.

**Our approach:**
We use both. Meetup for discovery, Luma for a polished landing page when sharing directly. Chapter leaders can decide what works for them. If you only want one platform, Meetup is the priority because of organic reach.

## Gamma

**What it is:** AI-powered slide deck creator.

**Website:** [gamma.app](https://gamma.app)

**What we use it for:**
- Event presentations (speaker intros, sponsor slides, closing remarks)
- Internal decks for fellow organizers
- Quick pitch decks when talking to potential partners

**Why it's useful:**
Gamma generates polished slides fast. You describe what you want, it builds a first draft. Good for chapter leaders who need to create presentations but don't want to spend hours in PowerPoint or Google Slides.

**Tips:**
- Start with a rough outline, then let Gamma expand it
- Edit the output. It's a starting point, not a finished product
- Export to PDF for sharing or presenting offline

## Docusaurus

**What it is:** Documentation site framework built on React.

**Website:** [docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io)

**What we use it for:**
- This documentation site you're reading right now
- Playbooks, brand guidelines, case studies
- A single source of truth for chapter operations

**Why it's useful:**
Markdown-based, version controlled, easy to update. If you can write markdown, you can contribute to the docs. Built-in search, sidebar navigation, and dark mode support.

**Tips:**
- Clone the repo, make changes, push. That's it.
- Use `.mdx` files if you need React components in your docs
- The sidebar is configured in `sidebars.ts`

## Cursor

**What it is:** AI-powered code editor built on VS Code.

**Website:** [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)

**What we use it for:**
- Updating this documentation site
- Writing and editing communications
- Quick edits to markdown files
- Building out new playbooks and pages

**Why it's useful:**
Cursor's AI can help you write, edit, and refactor. Ask it to draft a section, fix a typo, or restructure a document. It understands the codebase context, so it can make changes that fit the existing style.

**Tips:**
- Use Cmd+K to ask the AI to edit selected text
- Use Cmd+L to chat with the AI about the codebase
- It works great for non-code tasks like documentation

## What's Next

We'll add more tools as we find them useful. If you're a chapter leader and you've found something that helps, let us know.
