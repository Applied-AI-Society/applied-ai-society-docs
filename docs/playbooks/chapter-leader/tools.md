# Chapter Leader Tools

A collection of tools that help run chapters efficiently. These aren't endorsements. They're just what's working for us right now.

---

## Gamma

**What it is:** AI-powered slide deck creator.

**Website:** [gamma.app](https://gamma.app)

**What we use it for:**
- Event presentations (speaker intros, sponsor slides, closing remarks)
- Internal decks for fellow organizers
- Quick pitch decks when talking to potential partners

**Why it's useful:**
Gamma generates polished slides fast. You describe what you want, it builds a first draft. Good for chapter leaders who need to create presentations but don't want to spend hours in PowerPoint or Google Slides.

**Tips:**
- Start with a rough outline, then let Gamma expand it
- Edit the output. It's a starting point, not a finished product
- Export to PDF for sharing or presenting offline

## Docusaurus

**What it is:** Documentation site framework built on React.

**Website:** [docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io)

**What we use it for:**
- This documentation site you're reading right now
- Playbooks, brand guidelines, case studies
- A single source of truth for chapter operations

**Why it's useful:**
Markdown-based, version controlled, easy to update. If you can write markdown, you can contribute to the docs. Built-in search, sidebar navigation, and dark mode support.

**Tips:**
- Clone the repo, make changes, push. That's it.
- Use `.mdx` files if you need React components in your docs
- The sidebar is configured in `sidebars.ts`

## Cursor

**What it is:** AI-powered code editor built on VS Code.

**Website:** [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)

**What we use it for:**
- Updating this documentation site
- Writing and editing communications
- Quick edits to markdown files
- Building out new playbooks and pages

**Why it's useful:**
Cursor's AI can help you write, edit, and refactor. Ask it to draft a section, fix a typo, or restructure a document. It understands the codebase context, so it can make changes that fit the existing style.

**Tips:**
- Use Cmd+K to ask the AI to edit selected text
- Use Cmd+L to chat with the AI about the codebase
- It works great for non-code tasks like documentation
