# Getting Things Done

How to use Cursor as a command center for chapter operations.

:::note
This playbook is a stub. We'll flesh it out as we learn more about what works.

## The Idea

Running a chapter involves a lot of moving parts: documentation, outreach, event logistics, content creation, coordination. The typical approach is fragmented. Slack for comms. Notion for docs. Email for outreach. Google Drive for files. Each tool has its own context, and you're constantly context-switching.

There's a better way.

**Use Cursor as a command center.** Put everything in one workspace. Let an AI agent with full context help you move fast.

## Why Cursor

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor, but it's not just for code. It's a workspace where:

- **All your context lives in one place** — Docs, playbooks, meeting notes, artifacts, work logs. The agent sees everything.
- **You can issue commands** — Custom commands like `/create-artifact` or `/process-transcript` automate repetitive work.
- **MCP servers extend capabilities** — Connect to external tools and APIs. Browse the web. Interact with services.
- **You move faster** — Instead of switching between 5 apps, you work in one environment with an agent that knows your full context.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

*Coming soon: examples of workflows we run through Cursor.*

- Creating and updating playbooks
- Processing meeting transcripts into structured notes
- Generating problem briefs from pre-calls
- Drafting outreach messages
- Updating work logs
- Coordinating across internal and public documentation

## Custom Commands

*Coming soon: documentation of our custom commands and how to create your own.*

## MCP Servers

*Coming soon: which MCP servers we use and what they enable.*

## Getting Started

If you're a chapter leader and want to try this approach:

1. Clone the Applied AI Society workspace
2. Open it in Cursor
3. Explore the existing commands in `.cursor/commands/`
4. Start issuing commands and see what happens

More detailed setup instructions coming soon.
