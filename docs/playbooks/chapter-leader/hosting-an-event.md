# Hosting an Event

The soft skills, mental frameworks, and actual words that come out of your mouth when you're the host.

## The Host's Job

You're not just the organizer. Once the event starts, you become the **host**. Different role.

The host's job:

- **Set the tone.** Your energy is contagious. If you're excited, the room gets excited. If you're nervous and apologetic, the room feels it.
- **Make people feel welcome.** Especially newcomers. They don't know anyone. You're their first point of contact with this community.
- **Be the connective tissue.** You introduce people to each other. You bridge the segments. You keep things moving.
- **Give flowers.** Make sure the people who made this possible feel seen and appreciated.

You don't need to be the most charismatic person in the room. You need to be genuinely excited about what's happening and willing to share that energy.

---

## Mental Preparation

Hosting is a performance. Not in a fake way, but in the way that any public-facing role requires you to bring intentional energy. Here's how to prepare.

### The Day Before

- **Review the run of show.** Know the flow cold. What happens when. Who speaks in what order. You shouldn't be checking notes during transitions.
- **Prep your talking points.** Write down the key things you want to say at each transition. You don't need a script, but bullet points help.
- **Visualize success.** Seriously. Picture the event going well. See yourself confidently welcoming people, smoothly introducing speakers, gracefully handling a hiccup. Mental rehearsal works.

### Day Of

- **Protect your energy.** Don't drain yourself with stressful tasks right before. Delegate setup logistics if you can. You need to arrive fresh.
- **Arrive early.** Give yourself buffer time. Rushing creates anxiety. Being early lets you settle in, greet people as they arrive, and feel ownership of the space.
- **Move your body.** Before people arrive, do something physical. Walk around the block. Do some stretches. Shake out the nervous energy. Your body state affects your mental state.
- **Find your hype song.** Some hosts listen to a specific song before going on. Whatever gets you in the zone. Play it in your AirPods while setting up.

### Right Before You Go On

- **Take three deep breaths.** Slow inhale, slow exhale. Sounds basic. Works every time.
- **Remind yourself why you're doing this.** You built this event because you care about this community. You're excited about the speakers. You want people to connect. That's genuine. Lead with that.
- **Smile before you speak.** Your face sets the tone before your words do.

---

## Giving Flowers

One of your most important jobs: making the people who made this happen feel appreciated. Do this publicly and sincerely.

### Who Gets Thanked

| Who | When | Why |
|-----|------|-----|
| **Venue host** | Opening remarks | They gave you the space. This is huge. |
| **Sponsors** | Opening remarks (after venue) | They funded food, drinks, or logistics. |
| **Guest speakers** | When introducing them + closing | They prepared content and showed up. |
| **Business owner** (live session) | After their segment | They were vulnerable in public. |
| **Volunteers** | Closing remarks | Registration, photography, setup. They made it run. |
| **Community partners** | Opening or closing | If they helped promote or co-organized. |

### How to Give Flowers

Be specific. Generic thanks feel hollow.

**Bad:** "Thanks to Capital Factory for hosting us."

**Good:** "Huge thanks to Capital Factory for hosting us tonight. Specifically to [Name] who made this happen. She's been incredibly supportive of this community and we're grateful to have a home here."

**Bad:** "Thanks to our sponsor."

**Good:** "Tonight's food is sponsored by [Company]. They're building [brief description of what they do]. If you're interested in [relevant thing], find [Name]. He's here tonight in the [color] shirt."

### The Sponsor Moment

If a sponsor is present and wants to say a few words, give them a proper introduction:

```
Before we dive in, I want to give a moment to [Sponsor Company], who made tonight possible.

[Name] is here from [Company]. They're doing really interesting work in [brief, genuine description].

[Name], want to say a quick hello?
```

Keep sponsor remarks to 5-10 minutes max. If they're running long, you can gently wrap them:

```
This is great. I want to make sure we have time for our speakers, but [Name] will be around during networking if you want to learn more.
```

---

## Opening the Event

The first 5 minutes set the tone. Here's a template structure:

### 1. Welcome (30 seconds)

```
Hey everyone! Welcome to Applied AI Live.

For those who don't know me, I'm [Your Name]. I'm [your role, e.g., "one of the organizers of the Applied AI Society here in Austin"].

Thanks for being here tonight. We've got a great lineup.
```

### 2. Ice Breaker (optional, 15 seconds)

A quick, timely dad joke right after your welcome can loosen the room instantly. Pick something relevant to the audience, the topic, or current events in the AI community. The goal is one laugh that signals "this is going to be fun, not a lecture."

**Guidelines:**

- **Keep it to 1-2 jokes.** Don't do a set. Get your laughs and move on.
- **Timely and audience-appropriate.** Reference something the room will get. Inside jokes about the community, tools people are using, or recent AI news all work well.
- **Self-aware delivery.** Lean into the dad-joke energy. A slight pause before the punchline, maybe a knowing smile. If it bombs, "...anyway" with a grin is a perfect recovery.
- **Rotate material.** Don't reuse jokes across events. People come back.

**Example (if Clawd/OpenClaw is a known thing in your community):**

```
Before we dive in, quick question. What's a lobster's favorite programming language?

...Claw-jure.

Okay, now that I've gotten that out of my system, let's get started.
```

**Example (general AI audience):**

```
Quick one before we start. I asked ChatGPT to write me a joke about applied AI.

It gave me a 47-step implementation plan.

...which is why we do events like this instead.
```

The point isn't to be a comedian. It's to break the "polite audience silence" so people feel comfortable laughing, reacting, and engaging for the rest of the night.

### 3. Give Flowers: Venue + Sponsors (1-2 minutes)

```
Before we start, some quick thank-yous.

First, huge thanks to [Venue] for hosting us. [Specific person] made this happen. [One sentence about why they're great.] Give them a hand.

[Applause]

Tonight's food is brought to you by [Sponsor]. They're [one sentence about what they do]. [Name] is here. Find them during networking if you want to learn more.

[If sponsor wants to speak: "Actually, [Name], want to say a quick hello?"]
```

### 4. Frame the Event (1 minute)

Explain what's happening and why it matters. Make people excited about the format.

```
So here's what's happening tonight.

First, we've got [Speaker Name] sharing a case study on [topic]. This is real practitioner knowledge, the kind of stuff you can't Google.

Then we're doing something a little different. We have [Business Owner Name] here with a real business problem. And [Engineer Name] is going to architect a solution live, on the whiteboard, while you watch.

This isn't a polished demo. It's real problem-solving in real time. That's the point.
```

### 5. Housekeeping (30 seconds)

```
Quick housekeeping:

- Bathrooms are [location]
- Food and drinks are [location], help yourself
- We'll have networking time at the end, so stick around

Alright, let's get started.
```

### 6. Hype the Room (optional, 30 seconds)

If you want to build energy before the first speaker:

```
Real quick, look around the room.

We've got engineers building AI products. Business owners looking to level up. People who flew in from [city] for this.

This is the room. These are your people. Make sure you meet someone new tonight.

Okay. Let's bring up [Speaker Name].
```

If you're using a custom Q&A platform, announce the QR code early in this segment. At Applied AI Live #1, having a QR code on every slide drove engagement throughout the event. The AI moderation (using the NumFOCUS code of conduct) worked on its first outing and kept questions on-topic without manual filtering.

---

## Introducing Speakers

Don't read their LinkedIn bio. Build anticipation.

### Template Structure

1. **Why this talk matters** (1 sentence)
2. **Who they are** (1-2 sentences, the interesting version)
3. **What they're going to share** (1 sentence)
4. **Bring them up** (create energy)

### Example

**Bad introduction:**
```
Our next speaker is Rostam Mahabadi. He's an applied AI engineer based in Austin. He won the AITX x NVIDIA hackathon. Please welcome Rostam.
```

**Good introduction:**
```
Alright, so one of the hardest things in this field is figuring out how to actually get clients. How do you go from "I know how to build AI stuff" to "people are paying me to build AI stuff"?

Our first speaker figured that out. Rostam Mahabadi is an applied AI engineer here in Austin. He won the AITX x NVIDIA hackathon, which, by the way, is how I first heard about him. But more importantly, he's built a consulting practice doing exactly what we talk about at these events: helping real businesses implement AI.

He's going to share how he does it. Rostam, come on up.

[Lead the applause as they walk up]
```

### Tips

- **Lead the applause.** Start clapping as they walk up. The room follows your energy.
- **Make eye contact with the speaker.** As you hand off, look at them, smile, maybe a handshake or fist bump. Small gestures signal respect.
- **Get out of the way.** Once they're up, step aside. Don't hover.

---

## Transitions

The moments between segments are where events lose momentum. Your job is to keep energy up.

### After a Speaker Finishes

```
[Lead applause]

That was [Speaker Name]. Give them another hand.

[Applause]

[Optional: one sentence reaction, e.g. "That bit about [specific thing] is going to stick with me."]

Alright, we're going to take a 5-minute break. Grab some food, say hi to someone new. We'll start back up at [time] for the live architecture session.
```

### Transitioning to the Live Architecture Session

This is the signature segment. Build it up. Don't just introduce the business owner. Introduce their *philosophy* and the *tension* they're facing. Give the audience a reason to care before the whiteboard comes out.

**Template structure:**

1. Signal this is the main event
2. Introduce the business owner (who they are, credibility)
3. Introduce their philosophy or frame (what matters to them)
4. Name the tension (what's broken, what they're trying to protect)
5. State the architecture challenge
6. Bring them up

**Example:**

```
So here's what's about to happen.

We have a real business owner here with a real problem. And [Engineer] is going to architect a solution on the whiteboard while you watch. No prep slides. Just real problem-solving.

Let me introduce you to [Business Owner Name].

[Business Owner] is a [role] based in [city]. They've [1-2 credibility points, e.g. clients, accomplishments, scale].

Here's the interesting thing about [Business Owner].

They have this philosophy: [their frame, e.g., "there's soul work and there's soulless work"].

[Soul work description: the stuff that requires them, should never be automated].

[Soulless work description: the infrastructure that can be delegated].

The problem? [The tension, e.g., "Over 50% of their time is getting eaten by operational overhead instead of the work that actually matters."]

So the question is: [State the architecture challenge in one sentence].

That's what [Engineer] is going to architect. Live. Right now.

[Business Owner], [Engineer], come on up.

[Lead applause as they walk to the whiteboard]
```

The philosophy/frame is what makes the problem *interesting*, not just a generic "help me be more efficient." Find that frame in your pre-call with the business owner.

### If Something Runs Long

Gently redirect:

```
This is great. I want to make sure we have time for [next thing]. Maybe we can continue this during networking?
```

Or:

```
We could talk about this for hours. Let's do one more question and then move on.
```

---

## Closing the Event

Land the plane well. People remember how things end.

### Structure

1. **Recap what happened** (30 seconds)
2. **Thank everyone again** (1 minute)
3. **Call to action** (30 seconds)
4. **Send them off** (15 seconds)
5. **Last call announcement** (10 min before hard stop)

### Template

```
Alright everyone, that's a wrap on Applied AI Live.

Quick recap: [Speaker] shared how they [key takeaway]. And we just watched [Engineer] architect a solution for [Business Owner]'s [problem type] in real time. That's the kind of stuff you don't get anywhere else.

A few thank-yous before we close out:

- [Venue] for hosting us. [Specific person], thank you.
- [Sponsor] for the food and drinks.
- [Speaker names] for sharing their knowledge.
- [Business Owner] for being brave enough to workshop their problem in public.
- [Volunteers] ([names]) who helped with registration and photos.
- And all of you for showing up. This community is the people in this room.

If you want to stay connected:
- We're on [platform]: [handle or link]
- Next event is [date/TBD]. We'll announce soon
- If you want to get involved (speak, volunteer, partner), come find me

Alright. Stick around for networking. Meet someone new. Thanks for being here.

[Lead applause for the room]
```

### Last Call Announcement

If your venue has a hard stop, give people a heads up 10 minutes before:

```
[Get on mic briefly]

Hey everyone, quick heads up. We've got about 10 minutes before the venue needs to clear. Wrap up your conversations, exchange contact info if you haven't already. Thanks again for coming out.
```

This prevents awkward shepherding and lets people finish conversations gracefully.

## Handling the Unexpected

Things will go wrong. Here's how to handle common situations.

### Tech Issues

**Mic dies:**
```
[Project your voice] Looks like we're going acoustic for a second. [Continue while someone fixes it]
```

**Slides won't work:**
```
Tech is keeping us humble tonight. [To speaker] Want to just talk us through it while we figure this out?
```

**TV won't connect:**
Try cycling the display off and on. At Applied AI Live #1, the TV required on/off cycling before it recognized the laptop. Stay calm, narrate what's happening, and have someone troubleshoot while you keep the audience engaged with conversation or an impromptu Q&A.

**Computer goes to sleep mid-presentation:**
Set your laptop's sleep and hibernate settings to "never" before the event starts. This is easy to forget and awkward to recover from on stage. Add it to your day-of checklist.

**General principle:** Acknowledge it lightly, don't apologize profusely, keep moving. The audience is forgiving if you stay calm.

### Speaker Runs Long

If Q&A is eating into the next segment:

```
We've got time for one more question, then we need to move on. [To speaker] But stick around. People can grab you during networking.
```

### Awkward Silence During Q&A

If no one asks questions:

```
Alright, I'll kick us off. [Ask a question you're genuinely curious about]
```

Or:

```
Sometimes the best questions happen one-on-one. If you're thinking of something, grab [Speaker] during networking.
```

### Someone Asks a Hostile or Off-Topic Question

Redirect gracefully:

```
Interesting question. That might be a bit outside what we're covering tonight, but [Speaker], feel free to take that offline if you want.
```

Or:

```
I want to make sure we stay focused on [topic]. Let's table that one for now.
```

### Low Energy Room

If the room feels flat:

- **Move around.** Physical movement creates energy.
- **Ask the audience something.** "How many of you have tried [X]?" Get hands up.
- **Acknowledge it.** "Alright, I can tell everyone's still warming up. That's fine. Let's dive in."
