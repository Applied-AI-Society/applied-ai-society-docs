# Writing Event Descriptions

A guide and template for writing event listing descriptions for Applied AI Live events on Luma, Meetup, Eventbrite, or any event platform.

---

## Principles

These principles were extracted from the Applied AI Live #1 Luma description (preserved in full [below](#reference-applied-ai-live-1-description)).

### Lead with the value prop, not the org

The first paragraph should explain what attendees get, not who's hosting. "A workshop series for people who want to make money by practically applying AI" tells the reader immediately whether this is for them. Org details come later.

### Name the format explicitly

Set expectations early. "Workshop series" is better than "event." "People who want to make money by practically applying AI to real-world business problems in valuable industries" filters for the right audience and repels the wrong one.

### Speaker bios = credential + current work + what they'll share

Don't just list titles. Show why this person is credible *right now*:

- **Credential:** "creator of NumPy and SciPy"
- **Current work:** "founder of OpenTeams"
- **What they'll share:** "will speak on the importance of applied AI engineers and what his team is building"

Each speaker should earn their paragraph.

### Highlight the signature format

The live problem-solving element gets its own paragraph because it differentiates the event from every other AI meetup. If your event has a unique format element, give it space. Don't bury it in a list.

### "Who Should Attend" uses specific roles, not generic language

Good:
- "Engineers and developers who want to build a career (or side income) helping businesses integrate AI"
- "New grads trying to stand out in a dramatically changed job market"
- "Business owners curious about what's actually possible"

Bad:
- "Anyone interested in AI"
- "Tech professionals"
- "AI enthusiasts"

Specificity helps people self-select. If someone reads the list and thinks "that's me," they're more likely to RSVP.

### Co-host descriptions earn their space

Each hosting org gets a paragraph with mission + credibility signals. AITX's description mentions concrete numbers (50+ startup demos, chapters in three cities, running since 2022). Antler's description explains what they do and links to their application. These aren't filler; they give attendees context on who's behind the event.

### Sponsor acknowledgment is grateful and brief

State what sponsors do, why it matters, and move on. No hard sell. The Live #1 description thanks OpenTeams and OT Incubator by explaining their mission (infrastructure for applied AI, sovereignty over data) and connecting it to why the Society exists. One paragraph, done.

### Tone: direct, warm, practitioner-focused

No hype words. No "revolutionary," no "cutting-edge," no "game-changing." Just what's happening and why it matters. The description reads like it was written by someone who does the work, not someone marketing to people who don't.

## Section-by-Section Template

Use this structure when writing a new event description. Adapt the details, but keep the order and tone.

### About This Event

> This is [the Nth installment of / a new installment of] a workshop series for people who want to make money by practically applying AI to real-world business problems.
>
> The goal is to create a Schelling point for practitioners who are actually making a living helping businesses integrate AI — sharing exactly how they do it.

Then introduce each speaker in their own paragraph:

> **[Speaker Name]** [credential]. [Current work]. [What they'll share at this event].

Then call out the signature format:

> [Description of the live problem-solving element or other unique format]. This live problem-solving format is a core part of the series: real problems from real people in industry, solved in real time.

### Who Should Attend

3-5 bullet points. Use specific roles and situations, not generic categories.

> - Engineers and developers who want to build a career (or side income) helping businesses integrate AI
> - New grads trying to stand out in a dramatically changed job market
> - Technical leaders evaluating AI tools and workflows
> - Business owners curious about what's actually possible

### Hosted By

One paragraph per hosting organization. Include mission, credibility signals, and (optionally) a link.

> **Applied AI Society** — [One-sentence mission]. [What makes the community distinctive].
>
> **[Co-host Name]** — [Mission]. [Concrete credibility: numbers, history, reach]. [Brief invitation to join].
>
> **[Venue Partner]** — [What they do]. [Why they're relevant to the audience]. [Optional link].

### Sponsor Acknowledgment

**Two required sponsor acknowledgments for every event:**

**1. Founding sponsors (always include):**

> The Applied AI Society is grateful to OpenTeams and Open Technology Incubator as founding sponsors. OpenTeams is building the infrastructure layer for applied AI, and their commitment to democratizing AI access is core to why the Applied AI Society exists. OT Incubator's mission is to provide entrepreneurs with services and capital to create the transformative organizations and businesses that will bring about the Applied AI Economy.

**2. Venue/event sponsors (when applicable):**

For any event at Capital Factory / Station Austin, always include:

> Thank you to Station Austin for sponsoring [Event Name]. Station Austin is the center of gravity for entrepreneurs in Texas. They bring together the best entrepreneurs in the state and connect them with their first investors, employees, mentors, and customers. To sign up for a Station Austin membership, click here.

For other venue sponsors, follow the same pattern: grateful, brief, connected to mission.

## Tips

### Common mistakes

- **Leading with the org instead of the value.** Nobody RSVPs because of who's hosting. They RSVP because of what they'll get.
- **Generic "Who Should Attend" lists.** "AI enthusiasts" tells nobody anything. Be specific enough that the right people feel personally addressed.
- **Speaker bios that are just LinkedIn headlines.** Add what they'll actually share at this event. That's what converts interest into attendance.
- **Burying the unique format.** If you're doing a live architecture session, say so prominently. It's your differentiator.
- **Hype language.** Words like "revolutionary," "game-changing," and "cutting-edge" signal that the event has nothing concrete to offer. Let the content speak for itself.

### Length guidance

The Live #1 description is roughly 350 words. That's a good target. Long enough to cover all sections, short enough that people actually read it. If you're over 500 words, you're probably over-explaining.

### Platform-specific notes

- **Luma:** Supports rich text formatting. Use bold for speaker names and section headers. Luma truncates long descriptions behind a "Read more" link, so front-load the most important information.
- **Meetup:** Similar formatting support. Meetup audiences tend to skim, so keep paragraphs short.
- **Eventbrite:** Supports HTML. You can use headers and bullet lists, but don't over-design. Clean text outperforms styled layouts.
- **LinkedIn Events:** Very limited formatting. Write tighter; use line breaks instead of headers.

**About This Event**

This is the first installment of a workshop series for people who want to make money by practically applying AI to real-world business problems in valuable industries.

The goal is to create a Schelling point for practitioners who are actually making a living helping businesses integrate AI — sharing exactly how they do it.

Travis Oliphant (creator of NumPy and SciPy, founder of OpenTeams) will speak on the importance of applied AI engineers and what his team is building to help valuable institutions integrate AI.

Rostam Mahabadi has made a living building agentic workflows for major corporations in 2025 and is doubling down in 2026. He and his team just won the grand prize at the AITX x NVIDIA Hackathon. He'll share real case studies, then a real business owner will present an actual problem they're facing — and Rostam will architect a solution live.

This live problem-solving format is a core part of the series: real problems from real people in industry, solved in real time.

**Who Should Attend**

- Engineers and developers who want to build a career (or side income) helping businesses integrate AI
- New grads trying to stand out in a dramatically changed job market
- Technical leaders evaluating AI tools and workflows
- Business owners curious about what's actually possible
