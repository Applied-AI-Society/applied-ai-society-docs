# For Business Owners

You've heard the signal. AI is changing how businesses operate. You have problems you think AI might help with. But you're not a developer, and you're not sure where to start or who to trust.

This section is for you.

## The Three-Stage Path

Most AI projects fail because someone started building before the foundation was ready. We've seen it repeatedly: a practitioner writes code for a system that doesn't have clean data, defined processes, or someone who owns the outcome. Everyone gets frustrated. The project stalls.

The fix is a three-stage process that protects both you and the practitioner.

### Stage 1: Quick Check (2 minutes)

Six questions to find out if you're ready, close, or early. No commitment. Just clarity on where you stand and what to do next.

**[Take the Quick Check](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/quick-check)**

### Stage 2: Situation Map (30-minute guided session)

Map your current workflows, data, team, and gaps. This is best done as a conversation with a practitioner or AAS advisor, not as a form you fill out alone. Most business owners discover they haven't documented how things actually work. That discovery alone is worth the time.

### Stage 3: Opportunity Brief (20-30 minutes)

Translate your operational pain into a clear brief that any skilled practitioner can act on immediately. This is what an engineer reads to decide if they can help you.

## The Mindset That Matters

The best applied AI engagements don't end at delivery. They get better over time. Before you hire anyone, understand the difference between automation (doing the same thing faster) and continuous improvement (driving better outcomes). Read [Don't Accept Automation as the Goal](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/beyond-automation).

## Finding Help

The Applied AI Society connects business owners with vetted practitioners who are actually doing this work, not just talking about it.

The best way to get connected is to attend an [Applied AI Live](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/applied-ai-live) event in your city. These events are designed specifically for practitioners and business owners to interact in real time.

You can also reach out directly at [appliedaisociety.org](https://appliedaisociety.org).
