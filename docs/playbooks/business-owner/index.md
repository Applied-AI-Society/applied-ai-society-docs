# For Business Owners

You've heard the signal. AI is changing how businesses operate. You have problems you think AI might help with. But you're not a developer, and you're not sure where to start or who to trust.

This section is for you.

## What You Actually Need

You don't need to understand how large language models work. You don't need to take an AI course (though it helps). What you need is a clear way to translate your operational pain into something a skilled practitioner can act on.

That's what the resources here are designed to do.

## The First Step

Before you hire anyone or buy any tool, get clear on your problem. Most AI projects fail not because the technology didn't work, but because the problem wasn't scoped clearly from the start.

Start with the [Applied AI Opportunity Brief](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/opportunity-brief) — a structured template that helps you articulate your situation in a way any applied AI engineer can immediately understand.

## Finding Help

The Applied AI Society connects business owners with vetted practitioners who are actually doing this work, not just talking about it.

The best way to get connected is to attend an [Applied AI Live](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/applied-ai-live) event in your city. These events are designed specifically for practitioners and business owners to interact in real time.

You can also reach out directly at [appliedaisociety.org](https://appliedaisociety.org).
