# AI Readiness Assessment

Before you scope a project, you need to know where you stand.

Most AI engagements fail not because of technology. They fail because the business wasn't ready. The practitioner writes code for a system that doesn't have clean data, defined processes, or someone who owns the outcome. Everyone gets frustrated. The project stalls.

This assessment is the prerequisite. Complete it before filling out an [Applied AI Opportunity Brief](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/opportunity-brief). It helps you (and any practitioner you work with) understand your current situation clearly enough to know what's actually possible.

## Why This Step Exists

There is an extensive amount of situation and system assessing that needs to happen before you even know what to build. Skipping this step is the single most common reason applied AI projects disappoint.

Think of it this way: the Opportunity Brief asks "what specific project should we scope?" This assessment asks "are you in a position to scope anything yet, and if so, where should we focus?"

The honest answer might be: not yet. That's valuable information. It saves you months and tens of thousands of dollars.

## Part 1: Where Is the Pain?

Before diving into details, identify which area of your business has the biggest problem. In any business, there's a flow from top of funnel to delivery:

- **Lead generation and marketing**: Getting attention, finding prospects, creating content
- **Sales and outreach**: Converting interest into revenue, proposals, follow-ups
- **Operations and fulfillment**: Delivering the product or service, processing, execution
- **Distribution and delivery**: Getting the output to the customer
- **Administration and back office**: Invoicing, compliance, scheduling, internal coordination

Which of these areas has the most pain? You might have problems in multiple areas, but start with the one that costs you the most time, money, or frustration.

**Your answer:** ___

## Part 2: Map the Current Workflow

Now map how that area actually works today. Walk through it step by step. Be specific.

"We process invoices" is not useful. "Sarah opens the email, downloads the PDF, types the line items into QuickBooks, then emails the vendor a confirmation" is useful.

**What are the steps?** (Brief bullet points for each step in the workflow.)

**Who performs each step?**

**What tools or systems are involved at each step?**

**Where do things slow down, break, or require judgment calls?**

**How long does the full workflow take end to end?**

**How often does this workflow run?** (Daily, weekly, per patient, per transaction, etc.)

If you can't map your workflow, that's a finding. Many business owners discover they haven't documented their SOPs yet and can't prioritize what to automate because they haven't done an inventory of how things actually work. That mapping needs to happen before anything else.

---

## Part 3: Your Data

**What information exists that's relevant to this workflow?**

- Where does it live? (Spreadsheets, databases, email threads, PDFs, someone's head)
- Is it structured or unstructured? (A clean spreadsheet vs. a folder of scanned documents)
- How much of it is there? (Hundreds of records? Thousands? Millions?)
- How current is it? (Updated daily? Last touched in 2023?)
- Can it be exported? (Some vendor systems lock data behind proprietary formats)

If you can't answer these questions, that's a finding. It means data infrastructure work needs to happen before any AI work can begin.

---

## Part 4: Your Team

**Who would own this if it worked?**

- Is there a specific person who would manage the AI-assisted workflow day to day?
- Does that person have time and willingness to learn a new way of working?
- Is there someone technical on your team (even lightly technical) who could troubleshoot basic issues?
- Who makes the final call on budget and adoption?

If the answer to "who owns this" is unclear, that's the first thing to solve. AI tools without an owner become shelfware.

## Part 5: What Does Success Look Like?

### Define the Outcome (Not the Solution)

Don't say "I want an AI chatbot." Say what you actually want to happen differently.

- What would be true in 90 days if this worked perfectly?
- What metric would move? (Revenue, time saved, error rate, customer satisfaction, employee retention)
- How would you know it's working? What would you look at?

### Separate "Faster" from "Better"

This is a critical distinction. There are two kinds of improvement:

1. **Streamlining**: doing the same thing, faster or cheaper. The output quality stays the same.
2. **Enhancement**: doing a fundamentally better thing. The output quality improves over time.

Most people think they want #1. The real value is usually in #2. If you're only automating to equivalent quality, you're leaving the biggest opportunity on the table.

(For more on this distinction, see [Don't Accept Automation as the Goal](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/beyond-automation).)

## Part 6: Readiness Check

Check the statements that are true for your situation:

- [ ] We can map the workflow step by step (Part 2 above wasn't a struggle)
- [ ] The relevant data exists in a format that can be accessed digitally
- [ ] We have someone who would own and manage the AI-assisted workflow
- [ ] Leadership has allocated budget for this (even a rough range)
- [ ] We can articulate what success looks like in measurable terms
- [ ] We've tried at least one thing already (even if it didn't work)
- [ ] The team affected by this change is open to trying new tools

**If you checked 5 or more:** You're likely ready to move to the [Opportunity Brief](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/opportunity-brief).

**If you checked 3-4:** You're close. A scoping consultation could help you close the gaps. The main risk is starting a project before the foundation is solid.

**If you checked fewer than 3:** You have important groundwork to do first. That's not a failure. It's the most valuable thing you can learn before spending money on an AI engagement.

---

## Part 7: The Gaps

Based on your answers above, identify what needs to happen before a practitioner can write useful code.

Common gaps (check any that apply):

- [ ] **Process gap**: The workflow itself isn't clearly defined or documented
- [ ] **Data gap**: The information we need exists but isn't accessible, clean, or organized
- [ ] **Ownership gap**: Nobody has been designated to own the AI-assisted process
- [ ] **Measurement gap**: We don't have a baseline for current performance
- [ ] **Buy-in gap**: Key stakeholders haven't agreed this is worth pursuing
- [ ] **Technical gap**: Our systems don't support integration or data export

Each gap is a to-do item, not a blocker. But they need to be resolved before the AI work begins, not discovered mid-project.

## What Comes Next

If the assessment reveals you're ready: move to the [Applied AI Opportunity Brief](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/opportunity-brief). You now have the context to fill it out well. The brief will reference the workflow, data, and team details you mapped here.

If the assessment reveals gaps: work on closing them. Some of this work is internal (documenting processes, getting buy-in, designating an owner). Some of it might benefit from outside help (data cleanup, system integration, defining metrics).

Either way, you now know where you stand. That clarity is worth more than any premature engagement.
