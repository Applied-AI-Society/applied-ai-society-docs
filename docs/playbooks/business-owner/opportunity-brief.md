# Applied AI Opportunity Brief

:::tip Prerequisite
Before filling this out, complete the [Quick Check](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/quick-check) and [Situation Map](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/situation-map). They ensure you've identified your pain point, mapped your workflows, and confirmed you have the foundation to make this brief actionable.
:::

## Why This Brief Exists

The purpose of this brief is so we can get full context of where AI can help your business. Please over-communicate so we understand the depth of your problem.

Once complete, this document does three things:

1. **Clarifies your own thinking.** Most business owners discover important gaps and assumptions while working through this. That's part of the value.
2. **Enables fast matching.** Applied AI engineers can assess fit quickly without a long discovery process.
3. **Sets shared expectations.** Both sides have a common reference point from day one.

The more thoroughly you fill this out, the faster and better the help you'll get.

---

**Who fills it out:** The person leading AI adoption inside your company, ideally with input from the operational team closest to the problem.

**Who reads it:** Applied AI engineers you're considering for the engagement. Also useful for getting internal buy-in from leadership.

**Length target:** 1-3 pages. Keep answers concise. Brief bullet points are preferred over paragraphs.

## 1. Company Overview

**Company name:**

**Industry:**

**Size (employees / revenue range):**

**What your company does or what its main offering is (2-3 sentences):**

**The person filling this out:**
- Name and title:
- Role in the company:
- Relationship to the decision maker (owner, reports to owner, IS the owner, etc.):

---

## 2. The Problem

*You identified the area with the most pain and mapped the current workflow in your [Situation Map](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/situation-map). Now describe the specific problem an engineer would be solving.*

**What is the specific problem?** What's not working, what's too slow, or what's costing you the most?

**What does this problem cost you?** (Time per week, dollars lost, errors made, delays caused. Even rough estimates help.)

---

## 3. The Outcome You Want

**What would a good outcome look like in 90 days?**

**What would a great outcome look like in 12 months?**

**Is there a specific metric you want to use as your measure of success?** (Time saved, error rate reduced, revenue increased, cost eliminated, etc.)

**Who would benefit most from solving this, and why?** (Specific roles, teams, or customers)

Are you looking to do the same thing faster and cheaper, or to drive fundamentally better outcomes over time? (For more on why this matters, see [Don't Accept Automation as the Goal](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/beyond-automation).)

---

## 4. Technical Environment

*You mapped your tools and data in the [Situation Map](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/situation-map). Summarize the key details here for the engineer. Keep it brief. We'll go deeper on the call.*

**What software systems or tools are central to this problem?** (EHR, CRM, billing platform, custom software, etc.)

**Are any of these systems vendor-controlled or proprietary?** (Can data be exported? Is there an API?)

**Are there compliance constraints?** (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR, financial regulations, etc.)

---

## 5. People and Stakeholders

*Introducing AI workflows can significantly shift your company's culture. These questions help us understand the human side of this project.*

**Who has been involved in thinking about this problem so far?**

**Who would be involved in the project going forward?** (Day-to-day contact, subject matter expert, decision maker)

**Who needs to approve working with an AI engineer on this?**

**Who would be most affected if the workflow changed?** Any concerns about adoption or resistance?

---

## 6. Constraints

**What is your budget range for this project?** (Even a rough range helps: under $5K, $5-25K, $25-100K, $100K+)

**Timeline:** Is there a date by which something needs to be working? Is there urgency?

**Bandwidth:** How much time can you or your team realistically spend on this project per week?

**Deal-breakers:** Any hard constraints the engineer must know up front? (No cloud storage, must be self-hosted, can't change the core workflow, etc.)

---

## 7. Preliminary Ideas (Optional)

*You don't need answers here. This is just to share any instincts you already have.*

**Do you have a sense of what the solution might look like?**

**Have you seen something similar elsewhere that you'd want to model?**

**Anything you've tried yourself** (ChatGPT, workflow tools, vendor demos) and what you thought of it?

---

## 8. Visibility

**Are you open to this project being referenced publicly?** (As a case study, at a community event, in a practitioner's portfolio, etc.)

**Would you be interested in being featured at an Applied AI Live event**, where a practitioner architects a live solution to your problem in front of a community of applied AI engineers? (Optional, but it's one of the fastest ways to get quality help.)

## What Happens Next

After you submit this brief:

1. **We review it** and identify which parts need more depth.
2. **We schedule a call** to go deeper on the areas that matter most. This is where we'll walk through the full workflow, discuss technical constraints, and align on priorities.
3. **We match you** with a practitioner whose experience fits your problem.

The brief gets you 80% of the way there. The call gets the last 20%.
