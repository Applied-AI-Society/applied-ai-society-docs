# Applied AI Opportunity Brief

A scoping document you complete before engaging an applied AI engineer.

**What it does:** Translates your operational pain into a clear, actionable brief that any skilled practitioner can act on immediately — without weeks of back-and-forth discovery calls.

**Who fills it out:** The person leading AI adoption inside your company, ideally with input from the operational team closest to the problem.

**Who reads it:** Applied AI engineers you're considering for the engagement. Also useful for getting internal buy-in from leadership.

**Length target:** 1–3 pages. Be specific and concrete. Bullet points are preferred over paragraphs.

---

## 1. Company Overview

**Company name:**

**Industry:**

**Size (employees / revenue range):**

**What the company does (2–3 sentences):**

**The person filling this out:**
- Name and title:
- Role in the company:
- Relationship to the decision maker (owner, reports to owner, IS the owner, etc.):

---

## 2. The Problem

*Be as specific as possible. Dollar figures and time estimates make this section much more useful.*

**What operational problem are you trying to solve?**

**How is it handled today?** (Walk through the manual steps, tools involved, who does it.)

**How often does this problem occur?** (Daily, weekly, per patient, per transaction, etc.)

**What does this problem cost you?** (Time per week, dollars lost, errors made, delays caused)

**How long has this been a problem?**

**What have you already tried? What happened?**

---

## 3. The Opportunity

**What would a good outcome look like in 90 days?**

**What would a great outcome look like in 12 months?**

**How would you measure success?** (Be specific: time saved, error rate reduced, cost eliminated, etc.)

**Who would benefit most from solving this?** (Specific roles, teams, or customers)

---

## 4. Technical Environment

*This helps the engineer understand what they're working with and what's possible.*

**What software systems are central to this problem?** (EHR, CRM, billing platform, custom software, etc.)

**Are any of these systems vendor-controlled or proprietary?** (Can data be exported? Is there an API?)

**What data exists that's relevant to this problem?** (Patient records, transaction logs, emails, call transcripts, documents, etc.)

**How is that data currently stored?** (Spreadsheets, databases, cloud storage, PDFs, etc.)

**Are there compliance constraints?** (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR, financial regulations, etc.)

---

## 5. People and Stakeholders

**Who would be involved in this project on your side?** (Day-to-day contact, subject matter expert, decision maker for budget)

**Who needs to approve the engagement?**

**Who would be most affected by the change?** Are there culture or change management considerations?

**Has anyone on your team expressed skepticism about AI?** Any concerns to be aware of upfront?

---

## 6. Constraints

**Budget range:** (Even a rough range helps: under $5K, $5–25K, $25–100K, $100K+)

**Timeline:** Is there a date by which something needs to be working? Is there urgency?

**Bandwidth:** How much time can you or your team realistically spend on this project per week?

**Deal-breakers:** Any hard constraints the engineer must know up front? (No cloud storage, must be self-hosted, can't change the core workflow, etc.)

---

## 7. Preliminary Ideas (Optional)

*You don't need an answer here. This is just to share any instincts you already have.*

**Do you have a sense of what the solution might look like?**

**Have you seen something similar elsewhere that you'd want to model?**

**Anything you've tried yourself** (ChatGPT, workflow tools, vendor demos) and what you thought of it?

---

## 8. Engagement Preferences

**Are you open to this project being referenced publicly?** (As a case study, at a community event, in a practitioner's portfolio, etc.)

**Would you be interested in being featured at an Applied AI Live event**, where a practitioner architects a live solution to your problem in front of a community of applied AI engineers? (Optional — but it's one of the fastest ways to get quality help.)

**Preferred engagement type:**
- One-time scoping consultation (to get oriented on what to do next)
- Project-based engagement (defined scope, fixed deliverable)
- Ongoing retainer (continued support as problems evolve)
- Not sure yet

## What Happens After You Fill This Out

Once complete, this document does three things:

1. **Clarifies your own thinking.** Most business owners discover important gaps and assumptions while working through this. That's part of the value.
2. **Enables fast matching.** Applied AI engineers can assess fit quickly without a long discovery process.
3. **Sets shared expectations.** Both sides have a common reference point from day one.

If you want help filling this out, the Applied AI Society offers scoping consultations: a focused session that turns your operational situation into a clear, actionable brief. Reach out at [appliedaisociety.org](https://appliedaisociety.org) to get connected.
