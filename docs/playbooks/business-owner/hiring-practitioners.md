# Hiring Applied AI Practitioners

*The people who can help you actually use AI exist. Here's how to think about finding and working with them.*

---

## Why You Need Outside Help

Most businesses know they should be using AI. Very few have someone internally who can lead the transformation. Your existing team is busy running the business. They may be curious about AI, but curiosity alone doesn't close the implementation gap.

Applied AI practitioners are people who specialize in bridging that gap. They help organizations go from "we know AI matters" to "AI is working for us every day." The work ranges from automating specific workflows to transforming how your entire team thinks about and uses AI tools.

## What Practitioners Actually Do

Not all applied AI work looks the same. Understanding the different types of help available will save you time and money.

**Workflow automation.** A practitioner audits a specific process (lead intake, reporting, customer follow-up) and builds an automated version. This is the most common starting point. It's concrete, measurable, and usually delivers ROI quickly.

**Executive coaching.** A practitioner teaches you and your leadership team how to use AI tools directly. Not building custom software. Teaching you to use ChatGPT, Claude, or industry tools as a strategist, sense-maker, and decision-support system. Many executives underestimate how powerful this is.

**Culture transformation.** A practitioner helps your entire organization adopt AI. This looks like internal hackathons, training programs, and adoption frameworks. It's the hardest type of engagement to scope, but it's also the highest leverage. One cultural shift can unlock more value than a hundred individual automations.

**Custom tool building.** A practitioner builds something that doesn't exist yet. A custom AI agent, a specialized dashboard, an internal system that connects your data sources in new ways. This is deeper work that requires the practitioner to truly understand your business.

**Internal champion development.** You might already have someone on your team who could become your AI person. Investing in an internal champion (through training, time, and support) can be cheaper and faster than hiring externally. They already know your business, your culture, and your people. For more on this path, see the intrapreneurship section of [The Applied AI Economy](/docs/playbooks/practitioner/applied-ai-economy).

## The Startup Opportunity

Here's something most business owners don't consider: you might be sitting on a startup.

If you work with a skilled applied AI practitioner and together you solve a real problem in your industry, that solution probably isn't unique to you. Thousands of other businesses in your space have the same pain. You have the domain expertise. The practitioner has the technical skills. Together, you could build a product.

Vertical AI startups (AI products built for a specific industry) are one of the biggest opportunities in the economy right now. The best ones are co-founded by someone who knows the industry cold and someone who knows how to build with AI. If your practitioner engagement goes well, it's worth asking: could this be bigger than just us?

## How to Find Practitioners

The Applied AI Society exists to connect business owners with practitioners who are actually doing this work.

**Attend an event.** [Applied AI Live](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/applied-ai-live) events are designed for practitioners and business owners to meet in person. You'll see real implementations presented live and have the chance to talk directly with the people who built them.

**Post an opportunity.** If you have a specific need, [reach out to us](https://appliedaisociety.org/contribute). Our [north star](/docs/philosophy/north-star) is connecting practitioners with real applied AI opportunities. Your project could be someone's next great engagement.

**Start with the three-stage path.** Before you hire anyone, walk through our [Quick Check](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/quick-check), [Situation Map](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/situation-map), and [Opportunity Brief](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/opportunity-brief). These tools help you articulate what you actually need so the right practitioner can find you.
