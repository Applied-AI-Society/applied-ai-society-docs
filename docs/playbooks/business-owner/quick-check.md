# AI Quick Check

**Time: 2 minutes.** Answer six questions to find out where you stand.

---

### 1. How much pain are you in?

- **A.** This problem is costing us real money or time every week. We need to fix it.
- **B.** It's annoying but manageable. We're exploring options.
- **C.** We're just curious about what AI could do for us.

### 2. Can you point to the problem?

- **A.** Yes. I can name the specific workflow, who's affected, and roughly what it costs us.
- **B.** I have a general sense but haven't mapped it out.
- **C.** Not really. I just know things could be better.

### 3. Who makes the call?

- **A.** I'm the decision maker, or the decision maker has asked me to explore this.
- **B.** I'd need to convince someone above me, but I think I could.
- **C.** I'm not sure who would approve this or how.

### 4. Is there budget?

- **A.** Yes, we've set aside money for this (or would for the right solution).
- **B.** There's no formal budget, but we'd find money if the ROI was clear.
- **C.** Budget would be a hard conversation.

### 5. Have you used AI tools before?

- **A.** Yes. Our team uses ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI tools regularly.
- **B.** I've tried a few things personally, but the team hasn't adopted anything.
- **C.** Not really. This would be new for us.

### 6. Who would own this?

- **A.** I know exactly who would manage the AI-assisted workflow day to day.
- **B.** Probably me, but I'm already stretched thin.
- **C.** We'd need to figure that out.

## Your Results

### Mostly A's: You're ready.

You have a real problem, decision-making power, budget, and someone to own it. You don't need to be convinced that AI can help. You need to scope what to build.

**Your next step:** Complete the [Situation Map](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/situation-map) to document your current workflows, data, and team. Then move to the [Opportunity Brief](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/opportunity-brief) to scope the engagement.

### Mostly B's: You're close.

You have the instincts but not the foundation yet. The risk is starting a project before the groundwork is done. A little preparation now saves a lot of frustration later.

**Your next step:** Work through the [Situation Map](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/situation-map). It will show you exactly what gaps to close before engaging a practitioner. If you get stuck, the Applied AI Society offers [guided readiness consultations](https://appliedaisociety.org).

### Mostly C's: You're early.

That's not a bad thing. You're exploring, and that's smart. But you're not ready to scope a project yet. Jumping into an engagement now would likely frustrate both you and the practitioner.

**Your next step:** Start by attending an [Applied AI Live](/docs/playbooks/chapter-leader/applied-ai-live) event to see how practitioners actually work. Read [Don't Accept Automation as the Goal](/docs/playbooks/business-owner/beyond-automation) to understand what good looks like. When you have a specific pain point and the willingness to invest in solving it, come back.
