# Fractional AI Executive

*A new class of operator is emerging: experienced builders who embed directly with teams as part-time AI and product leaders. They bring 10+ years of shipping discipline and deep AI fluency, packaged as a service.*

---

## What They Do

The Fractional AI Executive embeds with a company's existing team on a part-time basis (typically 8 to 15 hours per week) and functions as a senior product and AI leader. They are not consultants who deliver a report and leave. They attend standups, join product meetings, scope features, train teams, and ship.

In practice, this means:

- Auditing existing workflows and identifying the highest-leverage AI opportunities (not the most impressive ones, the ones that actually move the business)
- Scoping and shipping AI integrations into the product, internal tools, and team processes
- Making product decisions with the speed and authority of a co-founder, without requiring a full-time hire or equity grant
- Training the team to build and evaluate AI systems themselves, so the dependency decreases over time

The defining characteristic: they operate, not advise. They are in the codebase, in the Slack channels, in the customer calls. The output is shipped product, not slide decks.

## Why This Role Is Emerging Now

Three forces are converging to create this role.

**First, AI capability is outpacing organizational readiness.** Most companies know AI matters. Very few have someone on the team who can translate that into a concrete product roadmap. They need someone senior enough to make decisions and technical enough to build.

**Second, the economics of fractional work have shifted.** An experienced product and AI leader costs $300K to $500K per year as a full-time hire. At $10K per month for 8 hours a week, a fractional executive delivers the same strategic judgment at a fraction of the cost. For startups and mid-size companies, this is the difference between having AI leadership and not having it.

**Third, the tools have caught up.** A single experienced operator with modern AI tooling can now do what used to require a team. They can audit a codebase, prototype an integration, and ship a production feature in the same week. The leverage has changed the math on what one person can deliver.

The early movers in this space (like Josh Pigford of [Initial Commit](https://initialcommit.co), who positions himself as a "Fractional AI + Product Co-founder") are establishing the model: no long contracts, no discovery phases, just embedded execution with a bias toward shipping.

## Who They Work With

**Founders and CEOs:** The primary relationship. The fractional executive needs direct access to decision-makers to move at speed. They function as a trusted co-pilot on product and AI strategy.

**Engineering teams:** They work alongside engineers, not above them. The best fractional AI executives write code, review PRs, and pair on architecture decisions. They earn trust by building, not by directing.

**Operations and go-to-market teams:** AI opportunities often live outside the product itself. Workflow automation, customer support systems, internal tooling. The fractional executive identifies these cross-functional wins.

## Skills and Background

The people stepping into this role share a pattern: they have shipped a lot of software over a long career, they have deep product instincts, and they caught the AI wave early enough to build real fluency.

Many are former founders. Some ran product or engineering at startups. What they all have is the scar tissue that comes from building 20, 50, or 80 products. They know which corners to cut and which ones to protect. They know how to scope a feature so it ships in weeks instead of months.

On the AI side, they are not researchers. They are practitioners. They know which models to use for which tasks, how to build reliable AI pipelines, and how to evaluate whether an AI integration is actually delivering value or just looking impressive in a demo.

The combination of shipping speed, product judgment, and AI fluency is what makes this role valuable. Any two of the three are common. All three together is rare.

## How They Typically Engage

Unlike traditional consulting, the engagement model is designed around accountability and speed:

- **Short diagnostic engagements** (1 to 2 weeks): Audit workflows, identify the biggest AI opportunity, and build the first quick win
- **Ongoing fractional embedding** (monthly): Regular hours each week, attending team meetings, shipping features, training the team
- **Focused sprints** (project-based): Scope a specific product, tool, or integration and ship it in weeks

Most operate without long-term contracts. The value should be obvious enough that the client wants to continue. If it isn't, both sides should be free to walk away.
