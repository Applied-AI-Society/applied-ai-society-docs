# Roles in the Applied AI Economy

The applied AI economy is creating careers that didn't exist two years ago. Most people don't know to look for them. Job boards haven't caught up. Career advisors are working from an outdated map.

This section documents the roles that are forming now, across every industry, as organizations try to actually deploy AI at scale. Some of these have names. Some are still being named. All of them pay well, and most of them have more open seats than qualified people to fill them.

## Why This Matters

The standard narrative is that AI is eliminating jobs. That's partly true. But it's not the whole story. Every major technological transition creates a new layer of work that didn't exist before. The internet didn't just eliminate travel agents. It created product managers, growth marketers, SEO specialists, DevOps engineers, and a hundred other roles nobody had a name for in 1995.

AI is doing the same thing, faster. The roles forming now sit at the intersection of technical capability and organizational judgment. They require people who understand both what AI can do and how organizations actually work. That combination is rare, which is why these roles command serious compensation.
