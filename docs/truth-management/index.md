# Truth Management

**Truth management** is the discipline of systematically documenting and organizing the conceptual frameworks that guide decision-making for individuals and organizations. It's about creating shared vocabularies, explicit principles, and coherent worldviews that enable aligned action by both humans and AI agents.

:::note[A note on terminology]
"Truth" here encompasses both your operational assumptions (working beliefs that guide action) and discovered realities (what you've learned actually works in practice). It's the full set of premises that an individual or organization uses to navigate the world effectively.

## Why This Matters

To change the world meaningfully, individuals and organizations must be deeply grounded in a foundation of truth: their assumptions about reality, motivating narrative, and decision-making frameworks. Without this grounding, individuals operate from unconscious contradictions and organizations suffer from misaligned assumptions that create coordination failures.

Truth management solves this by systematically documenting and evolving shared understanding. When truth is made explicit through version-controlled documentation, scattered assumptions are replaced by coherent foundations for aligned action for every human and AI involved.

## The Framework

### Principles

Core operating principles for effective truth management:

- [**Align Before Committing**](./align-before-committing) - Never start meaningful projects without explicit, documented alignment
- [**Don't Assume Common Sense**](./dont-assume-common-sense) - Remove "common sense" from your vocabulary; only shared understanding exists
- [**Empower Your Truth Manager**](./empower-your-truth-manager) - Truth management requires real authority to enforce organizational coherence
- [**Make Every File Count**](./make-every-file-count) - Every document must actively support right action with minimal noise
- [**Make Your Company Refactorable**](./make-your-company-refactorable) - Can you grep and edit your entire company OS with an agent call? If not, why?
- [**Protect Your Truth**](./protect-your-truth) - Match security controls to sensitivity levels

### Processes

Systematic workflows for implementing truth management:

- [**Start Your Company Bible**](./start-your-company-bible) - Build comprehensive documentation capturing your organization's "way"
- [**Migrate to Refactorable Systems**](./migrate-to-refactorable-systems) - Move from siloed tools to grep-able, version-controlled formats
- [**Truth as Context**](./truth-as-context) - Ensure AI agents have full organizational context when creating or modifying documentation

### Tools

- [**Source Controller**](./source-controller) - Version control platforms (e.g., GitHub) that store and evolve your truth repository
- [**Voice Transcriber**](./voice-transcriber) - Speech-to-text tools that lower the friction between thinking and documenting

## About

This framework was created by [Gary Sheng](https://garysheng.com), founder of the Applied AI Society. It emerges from observing that competitive advantage increasingly comes from organizational capability rather than just proprietary technology. As AI agents become integral to how work gets done, organizations with well-documented truth gain compounding advantages: their agents operate from the same foundations as their humans, enabling coordinated action at unprecedented speed.

Truth management as a discipline is still nascent territory. The Applied AI Society is committed to doing this right from day zero: building our entire organizational infrastructure on these principles from the start, rather than retrofitting them later. Our workspace is a living implementation of this framework, and we're learning and evolving these ideas in real time.
