# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

Applied AI Society is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of background. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
