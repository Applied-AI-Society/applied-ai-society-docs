# Brand Guidelines

The Applied AI Society visual identity. Warm, natural, and human.

## Philosophy

Our brand is intentionally **not techy**. No circuits, no glowing grids, no dystopian sci-fi aesthetics. When people imagine the future of AI, they often picture something cold and mechanical. We want the opposite.

Think Windows XP's rolling hills. There's a reason that became iconic. Humans are naturally primed to feel good about green pastures and blue skies. It's calming. It feels like home.

The Applied AI Society represents a **natural, positive progression** for humanity. AI isn't something to fear. It's a tool that helps people do meaningful work. Our brand should feel like that: grounded, optimistic, and welcoming.

## Visual Direction

**Sunrise over rolling hills.** Warm oranges and ambers convey energy and new beginnings. Cream backgrounds feel inviting. Olive greens ground us in nature and growth.

The specifics will evolve, but the vibe persists: **this is good, this is natural, this is part of something hopeful.**

**Why orange?** It stands out. It's warm without being aggressive. And it's having a moment. Fashion, design, tech. Orange is trendy. It catches the eye without screaming at you.

## Usage

When creating materials for the Applied AI Society:

1. **Use the orange (<InlineColor color="#E67B35" />)** — It's our signature color. Don't dilute it with too many other bright colors.
2. **Keep backgrounds warm (<InlineColor color="#FAF7F1">Cream</InlineColor>)** — Cream backgrounds feel more human than pure white.
3. **Download official assets** — Don't recreate logos from scratch. Use the provided files.
