## Usage

When creating materials for the Applied AI Society:

1. **Use the orange** — It's our signature color. Don't dilute it with too many other bright colors.
2. **Keep backgrounds warm** — Cream backgrounds feel more human than pure white.
3. **Download official assets** — Don't recreate logos from scratch. Use the provided files.
