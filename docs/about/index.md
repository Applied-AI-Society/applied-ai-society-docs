# What is the Applied AI Society?

## The Moment We're In

AI models are advancing faster than anyone predicted. New breakthroughs land every week. And if you're early in or evolving your career right now, you're probably feeling two things at once: excitement about what's possible, and anxiety about what it means for your future.

You're not alone. Businesses don't know how to use this stuff either. There's a massive gap between what AI can do and what organizations are actually doing with it.

That gap is the opportunity.

Nobody has this figured out. So let's all agree nobody has this figured out, and let's share notes.

## What We Are

The Applied AI Society is a community of people learning to apply AI professionally. Our focus is on college-aged students transitioning into the workforce, but we're open to all professionals.

Through hyperlocal chapters led by young leaders, we create spaces where the next generation of applied AI practitioners learns by doing. We host events, share open documentation, and connect members with businesses that need their fluency.

We call the people who bridge the gap between AI capability and real-world implementation "Applied AI Engineers." They help organizations actually use AI to better serve their customers and communities. That's the career path we're building together.

## What We Believe

At the heart of everything we do is a simple idea: AI should free people to do more meaningful work, not replace them.

Some work requires a human soul: presence, judgment, taste, care, responsibility. Some work is necessary but doesn't carry that weight. Thinking machines exist to carry the second kind so humans can spend more time on the first.

That's the [Applied AI Canon](/docs/philosophy/canon). Efficiency is not the goal. More soul-requiring work is.

## How It Works

**Chapters.** Applied AI Society runs through hyperlocal chapters in cities and on campuses. Each chapter is led by young people who are already AI-native. They organize events, build community, and create a space where people figure out AI use cases together (not alone).

**Applied AI Live.** Our flagship event format. Practitioners present real implementations, live. Real people showing real systems they built for real organizations. Live discussions between fellow practitioners on what's emerging.

**Open Documentation.** Everything we learn gets documented and shared publicly. Playbooks for running chapters and hosting events. Standards for emerging agent file conventions. Case studies from real implementations. If we figure something out, we write it down so the next person doesn't have to start from scratch.

**Sponsors, not gatekeepers.** Local businesses and AI companies sponsor chapters because they want access to AI-native talent. Sponsors fund the community. They don't control it.

## For Students and Emerging Practitioners

You already use AI every day. You prompt, you iterate, you build things your professors haven't seen yet. That's real fluency. The problem is there's no clear path from "I use AI" to "I apply AI professionally."

Applied AI Society is that path.

You'll meet practitioners who are doing this work right now. You'll see real implementations, not demos. You'll build a portfolio of applied work and connect with organizations that need exactly what you know how to do.

Don't think of yourself as "I don't know anything." You're AI native. You can pick things up. You're flexible. That matters more than any credential right now.

## For Universities and Young Adult Organizations

Your students and young members are anxious about AI and their careers. They're right to be. The job market is shifting under their feet, and traditional curricula can't keep up with weekly model releases.

Applied AI Society gives young people a community where they can channel that anxiety into action. Our events draw participants from across departments and backgrounds (not just CS) because applied AI is cross-disciplinary. Business students, design students, liberal arts students all bring perspectives that make implementations better.

Bringing a chapter to your campus or organization means your people get access to practitioners, open resources, and a national network of peers. If you already have a venue that wants this kind of programming, it costs nothing to start. You may want to invest in things like AV and recording, but the barrier to entry is low. We provide the playbooks, the event formats, and the community infrastructure.
