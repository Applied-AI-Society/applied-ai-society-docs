# Principles

What we believe and how we operate.

---

## 01. AI should be a jetpack, not a replacement

We empower humans to work **ON** the business, not **IN** it.

AI's greatest potential isn't replacing workers. It's amplifying what humans can do. We focus on implementations that free people from repetitive tasks so they can focus on judgment, creativity, and relationship-building.

---

## 02. The gap isn't innovation—it's implementation

Most businesses aren't using what already exists.

The frontier models are impressive, but the real opportunity is helping the millions of businesses who haven't even scratched the surface of what's already possible. We close that gap.

---

## 03. Business outcomes over technology fascination

Results matter, not benchmarks.

We don't care about the latest model benchmarks. We care about measurable results: time saved, costs cut, employee and customer satisfaction increased, revenue grown.

---

## 04. Vendor-neutral, standards-first

We're loyal to open tools, not vendors.

We're not here to promote one company over another. Our loyalty is to open tools and solutions that conform to emerging and existing standards—making implementation easier and avoiding lock-in.

---

## 05. AI autonomy over AI dependency

You should own your AI capabilities, not rent them.

Businesses should own their AI capabilities, not rent them. We favor solutions that give organizations control, portability, and independence.

---

## 06. Open Documentation

Every case study, every workflow pattern, every success and failure—shared freely.

The whole community benefits when we learn in public. That's why we document everything and share it openly.

*These principles guide everything we do. They're not just words—they inform how we evaluate tools, structure case studies, and advise businesses.*
