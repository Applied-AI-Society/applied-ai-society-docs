# Principles

The [Canon](/docs/philosophy/canon) declares why we exist. These four principles define how we operate as a community.

---

## 01. The gap isn't innovation, it's implementation

Most businesses aren't using what already exists.

The frontier models are impressive, but the real opportunity is helping the millions of businesses who haven't even scratched the surface of what's already possible. We close that gap.

---

## 02. Business outcomes over technology fascination

Results matter, not benchmarks.

We don't care about the latest model benchmarks. We care about measurable results: time saved, costs cut, employee and customer satisfaction increased, revenue grown.

---

## 03. Vendor-neutral, standards-first

We're loyal to open tools, not vendors.

We're not here to promote one company over another. Our loyalty is to open tools and solutions that conform to emerging and existing standards, making implementation easier and avoiding lock-in.

---

## 04. Open documentation

Every case study, every workflow pattern, every success and failure, shared freely.

The whole community benefits when we learn in public. That's why we document everything and share it openly.

*These principles guide everything we do. They inform how we evaluate tools, structure case studies, and advise businesses.*
