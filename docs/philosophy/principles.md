# Principles

The [Canon](/docs/philosophy/canon) declares why we exist. These six principles define how we operate as a community.

---

## 01. The gap isn't innovation, it's implementation

Most businesses aren't using what already exists.

The frontier models are impressive, but the real opportunity is helping the millions of businesses who haven't even scratched the surface of what's already possible. We close that gap.

---

## 02. Invest in young people first

Young people who are comfortable with AI are the most important group we serve.

They see the world without barriers. They are not intimidated by new tools. They learn fast, build fast, and bring energy that revitalizes the organizations around them. We exist to help them channel their AI fluency into professional capability. When we invest in AI-native young people, everything else follows: experienced practitioners have apprentices, businesses have the best hires of the next decade, and communities gain leaders who understand both technology and humanity. The talent pipeline is not the goal. It is the natural outcome of putting young people first.

## 03. Business outcomes over technology fascination

Results matter, not benchmarks.

We don't care about the latest model benchmarks. We care about measurable results: time saved, costs cut, employee and customer satisfaction increased, revenue grown.

---

## 04. Vendor-neutral, standards-first

We're loyal to open tools, not vendors.

We're not here to promote one company over another. Our loyalty is to open tools and solutions that conform to emerging and existing standards, making implementation easier and avoiding lock-in.

---

## 05. Open documentation

Every case study, every workflow pattern, every success and failure, shared freely.

The whole community benefits when we learn in public. That's why we document everything and share it openly.

---

## 06. Bridge builders and practitioners

The implementation gap closes when technical and non-technical people learn from each other.

We build environments where builders, open source contributors, advocates, and practitioners unlock value the other groups hold. Tacit knowledge (the kind you can only gain through experience) flows when these worlds overlap.

*These principles guide everything we do, starting with the young people at the center of our mission.*
