# The Applied AI Canon

*Eight tenets that define what Applied AI means.*

---

**I. There is soul-requiring work.**
Some work requires presence, judgment, taste, care, and responsibility.
This work cannot be automated without being diminished.

---

**II. There is non-soul work.**
Some work is necessary but does not require meaning or presence.
This work should be delegated whenever possible.

---

**III. Thinking Machines exist to carry the non-soul work.**
They reason, remember, and execute.
They do not feel, discern meaning, or bear responsibility.

---

**IV. Service flows one way.**
Thinking Machines serve humans.
Humans do not serve Thinking Machines.

---

**V. Ownership over dependency.**
People and organizations should own their AI capabilities, not rent them.
Any system that creates dependency where autonomy is possible is misapplied AI.

---

**VI. Efficiency is not the goal.**
Efficiency is a tool.
The goal is more soul-requiring work in the world.

---

**VII. Automation must increase humanity.**
If an application of AI reduces presence, judgment, or care, it fails.
If it frees humans to do soul-requiring work, it succeeds.

---

**VIII. Applied AI exists to free, not to replace.**
The end state is humans
doing the work only humans can do.
