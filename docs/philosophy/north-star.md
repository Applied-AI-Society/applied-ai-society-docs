# North Star

*The one metric that tells us whether we're succeeding.*

---

## First Applied AI Opportunities

Everything we do rolls up to a single question: **are we connecting people with real Applied AI opportunities?**

Events build community. Content builds awareness. Playbooks build capability. But the moment that matters is when someone gets connected to their first (or next) Applied AI engagement because of this society.

That's the metric we track. Not attendance, not follower counts, not content impressions. Those are leading indicators. The north star is **opportunity matches**: introductions we make between engineers, practitioners, and the people who need their help.

## Why This Metric

The [Canon](/docs/philosophy/canon) says efficiency is a tool, not the goal. The goal is more soul-requiring work in the world. Our [Principles](/docs/philosophy/principles) say business outcomes over technology fascination.

Opportunity matches sit at the intersection of both. When we connect an engineer with a company that needs applied AI work, we're not just growing a network. We're putting a real person in a position to do real work that matters.

## What Counts

- Connecting a practitioner with a company or individual who needs AI implementation help
- Introducing an engineer to a freelance, contract, or full-time applied AI role
- Matching a young person with an apprenticeship or first AI project
- Any society-facilitated introduction that leads to paid Applied AI work

*We measure what matters. Everything else is a means to this end.*
