# North Star

*How we hold ourselves accountable to you.*

## The Promise

Applied AI Society exists to shorten the time for young people to get their first applied AI money-making opportunity. Every event, every playbook, every connection in the network should serve that goal. So the question we keep asking ourselves is simple: **are we actually doing that?**

## What We Measure

Not attendance. Not follower counts. Not content impressions. Those matter as leading indicators, but they're not the point.

The metric that matters is **opportunity matches**: introductions we make between practitioners and the people who need their help. Every consulting gig, freelance contract, startup collaboration, or full-time role that flows through the network counts. The moment someone gets connected to their first (or next) applied AI engagement because of this society, that's a win.

Events pull people into the applied AI economy. Content builds awareness. Playbooks build capability. But the thing we actually track is whether those inputs lead to real opportunities for real people.

## Why This Metric

The [Canon](/docs/philosophy/canon) says efficiency is a tool, not the goal. The goal is more soul-requiring work in the world. Our [Principles](/docs/philosophy/principles) say business outcomes over technology fascination.

Opportunity matches sit at the intersection of both. When we connect a practitioner with someone who needs applied AI work done, we're putting a real person in a position to do real work that matters. That's the path we're building: from "I want to do this" to "I'm getting paid to do this."

## What Counts

- A practitioner gets connected with a company or individual who needs AI implementation help
- Someone lands a freelance, contract, or full-time applied AI role through the network
- A young person gets matched with an apprenticeship or first AI project
- Any introduction facilitated through the society that leads to paid applied AI work

If you've gotten an opportunity through the Applied AI Society, [we'd love to hear about it](https://appliedaisociety.org/contribute). Your story helps us understand what's working and helps the next person see what's possible.
