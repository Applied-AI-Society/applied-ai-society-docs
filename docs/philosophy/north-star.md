# North Star

*The one metric that tells us whether we're succeeding.*

## First Applied AI Opportunities

Applied AI Society exists to shorten the time for young people to get their first applied AI money-making opportunity. So the metric is simple: **are we actually doing that?**

Events initiate people into the applied AI economy. Content builds awareness. Playbooks build capability. But the moment that matters is when someone gets connected to their first (or next) applied AI engagement because of this society.

That's the metric we track. Not attendance, not follower counts, not content impressions. Those are leading indicators. The north star is **opportunity matches**: introductions we make between practitioners and the people who need their help. Every consulting gig, freelance contract, startup collaboration, or full-time role that flows through the network counts.

## Why This Metric

The [Canon](/docs/philosophy/canon) says efficiency is a tool, not the goal. The goal is more soul-requiring work in the world. Our [Principles](/docs/philosophy/principles) say business outcomes over technology fascination.

Opportunity matches sit at the intersection of both. When we connect a practitioner with someone who needs applied AI work done, we're not just growing a network. We're putting a real person in a position to do real work that matters. We're shortening the path from "I want to do this" to "I'm getting paid to do this."

## What Counts

- Connecting a practitioner with a company or individual who needs AI implementation help
- Introducing someone to a freelance, contract, or full-time applied AI role
- Matching a young person with an apprenticeship or first AI project
- Any society-facilitated introduction that leads to paid applied AI work

*We measure what matters. Everything else is a means to this end.*
