# Case Studies & Practitioner Profiles

Real projects, real practitioners, documented openly.

This section features two kinds of content: **project case studies** showing how AI was applied to solve a specific business problem, and **practitioner profiles** showing how individuals are building careers in the applied AI economy. Both serve the same purpose: giving you a concrete picture of what this work actually looks like.
